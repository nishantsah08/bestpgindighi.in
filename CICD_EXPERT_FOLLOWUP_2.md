# Second Follow-up Request for CI/CD Expert Review

**Date:** Wednesday, August 6, 2025

## 1. Summary

This is a second follow-up to the ongoing CI/CD issue. The workflow is still failing with the `NOT_FOUND` error when trying to describe the Artifact Registry repository, despite implementing the expert's latest recommendations and confirming that the `gcloud` CLI is now authenticated.

## 2. Implemented Changes

Based on the expert's advice, the following changes were made to the `.github/workflows/deploy_to_cloud_run.yml` file:

1.  **`export_default_credentials: true`:** This was added to the `google-github-actions/auth` step to ensure that Application Default Credentials (ADC) were exported to the shell.
2.  **Separated GAR and Cloud Run Regions:** The workflow was updated to use separate environment variables for the GAR and Cloud Run locations (`GAR_LOCATION` and `RUN_REGION`).

## 3. The Contradictory Results

The latest workflow run has produced a deeply contradictory set of results:

1.  **Authentication Success:** The "Who am I?" step now correctly shows that the service account is active and that ADC is working:
    ```
    Credentialed Accounts
    ACTIVE  ACCOUNT
    *       firebase-adminsdk-fbsvc@***.iam.gserviceaccount.com
    ```
2.  **`gcloud` Failure:** The very next step, `Describe GAR repo`, still fails with the `NOT_FOUND` error.

This is the core of the problem. The runner is authenticated, but `gcloud` is behaving as if it is not.

## 4. The Unanswered Question

Why is the `gcloud artifacts repositories describe` command failing with a `NOT_FOUND` error when it is being run in a confirmed authenticated environment?

## 5. Request to the Expert

Could you please review the latest logs and workflow file to help diagnose this contradictory behavior? Is there a known issue or a subtle interaction between the GitHub Actions runner, the `google-github-actions/auth` action, and the `gcloud` CLI that could be causing this?
