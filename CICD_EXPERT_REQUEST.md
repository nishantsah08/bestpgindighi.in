# Request for CI/CD Expert Review

**Date:** Wednesday, August 6, 2025

## 1. Objective

The goal is to deploy a standard Python FastAPI application, containerized with Docker, to Google Cloud Run. The deployment must be automated through a GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow.

## 2. The Problem: Persistent `docker push` Failure

The CI/CD workflow is consistently failing at the "Build & Push (Dockerfile)" step.

The exact error message from the GitHub Actions log is:
```
name unknown: Repository "cloud-run" not found
```

This error occurs during the `docker push` command, which is attempting to push the newly built image to the Google Artifact Registry.

## 3. Current Workflow File

The failing workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/deploy_to_cloud_run.yml`:

```yaml
name: Deploy to Cloud Run

on:
  push:
    branches: [walking-skeleton]

env:
  PROJECT_ID: ${{ secrets.GCP_PROJECT_ID }}
  REGION: asia-south1
  SERVICE_NAME: api-backend
  REPO: cloud-run

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Google Auth
        uses: 'google-github-actions/auth@v1'
        with:
          credentials_json: '${{ secrets.GCP_SA_KEY }}'

      - name: Set up gcloud
        uses: 'google-github-actions/setup-gcloud@v2'

      - name: Configure Docker auth for Artifact Registry
        run: gcloud auth configure-docker ${{ env.REGION }}-docker.pkg.dev --quiet

      - name: Build & Push (Dockerfile)
        run: |
          IMAGE_URI="${{ env.REGION }}-docker.pkg.dev/${{ env.PROJECT_ID }}/${{ env.REPO }}/${{ env.SERVICE_NAME }}:${{ github.sha }}"
          docker build -t "$IMAGE_URI" .
          docker push "$IMAGE_URI"
          echo "IMAGE_URI=$IMAGE_URI" >> $GITHUB_ENV

      - name: Deploy to Cloud Run (image)
        uses: 'google-github-actions/deploy-cloudrun@v1'
        with:
          service: ${{ env.SERVICE_NAME }}
          region: ${{ env.REGION }}
          image: ${{ env.IMAGE_URI }}
          allow_unauthenticated: true
```

## 4. Troubleshooting Steps Already Taken

The error message `Repository "cloud-run" not found` appears to be misleading. Here is what has been verified:

1.  **Authentication Succeeds:** The "Google Auth", "Set up gcloud", and "Configure Docker auth" steps all complete successfully in the workflow log. This indicates that the service account credentials are correct and are being used to authenticate with Google Cloud.

2.  **Repository Exists:** I have manually confirmed that the Artifact Registry repository named `cloud-run` **does exist** in the `asia-south1` region and its format is set to "Docker".

3.  **Permissions are Correct:** I have manually granted the `roles/artifactregistry.writer` role to the service account (`firebase-adminsdk-fbsvc@fir-bestpg.iam.gserviceaccount.com`) for the `cloud-run` repository.

4.  **Persistence:** The failure is not transient. Re-running the workflow multiple times results in the exact same error at the exact same step.

## 5. Hypothesis

The successful authentication steps followed by the "repository not found" error strongly suggest that the issue is not with the repository's existence or permissions. The problem likely lies in a subtle misconfiguration within the GitHub Actions runner environment itself, specifically in how the `docker push` command is resolving the repository path. It seems the authenticated context is not being correctly applied, or the `PROJECT_ID` variable is not being expanded as expected at the moment the `docker push` command is executed.

## 6. Request to the Expert

Could you please review the workflow file and the situation described above to identify the root cause of this failure? The core question is: **Why is `docker push` failing with a "repository not found" error when all authentication and permission checks appear to be successful?**
