# Project Progress Report: FastAPI Deployment to Cloud Run

**Date:** Tuesday, August 5, 2025

## 1. Initial Objective

The primary goal is to deploy a Python FastAPI backend, containerized with Docker, to Google Cloud Run. This deployment is to be automated via a GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline.

## 2. Summary of Challenges

The project has been plagued by a persistent and misleading error: `Container called exit(0)`. This error indicated that the `gunicorn` process within the Docker container was starting and then immediately terminating without an error code. This caused the Google Cloud Run health checks to fail and the deployments to be rolled back.

## 3. Key Breakthrough: The Root Cause

After extensive troubleshooting and analysis of similar issues in other projects, the root cause was identified:

**The GitHub Actions workflow was deploying the application from source, which caused Google Cloud Run to use Cloud Buildpacks. The buildpacks ignored our `Dockerfile` entirely.**

Because the project structure did not match the expectations of the Python buildpack, it created a generic, non-functional container that would exit immediately. This explains why none of our `Dockerfile` changes were having any effect.

## 4. The "Expert" Solution and Current Status

Based on a detailed analysis provided by an external expert, a new, best-practice CI/CD pipeline has been implemented.

**Key Changes:**

1.  **`gunicorn` Dependency:** The `gunicorn` package was added to the `requirements.txt` file.
2.  **New Workflow:** The old, broken workflow (`deploy_full_stack.yml`) was deleted and replaced with a new workflow (`deploy_to_cloud_run.yml`) that explicitly builds and pushes our `Dockerfile` to the Google Artifact Registry, and then deploys that specific image to Cloud Run.
3.  **Artifact Registry:** A new Artifact Registry repository named `cloud-run` was created to store the Docker images.
4.  **Hardened `Dockerfile`:** The `Dockerfile` was updated to use the `shell` form of the `CMD` instruction, which is critical for correctly substituting the `$PORT` environment variable provided by the Cloud Run environment.

**Current Status:**

The new pipeline has been implemented and is currently running. We are awaiting the results of the latest run to confirm that the new configuration has resolved the deployment issue.

## 5. Next Steps

*   Monitor the current workflow run to its conclusion.
*   If the run is successful, verify the deployment by accessing the `/api/health` endpoint of the live Cloud Run service.
*   If the run fails, analyze the new logs to identify the next steps.
