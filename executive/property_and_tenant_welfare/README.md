# Ministry of Property & Tenant Welfare - Playbook

This document outlines the standard operating procedures for the Caretaker.

## Core Responsibilities

- Maintaining the physical property.
- Responding to maintenance requests.
- Assigning beds to new tenants upon proper authorization.

## Tenant Onboarding Workflow

1.  **Await Authorization:** Your only role in the onboarding process is to wait for the official, pre-recorded WhatsApp audio message from the system.
2.  **Assign Bed:** Once you receive the audio message, you are authorized to assign a bed to the new tenant.
3.  **Do Not Assign Without Authorization:** Under no circumstances should you assign a bed without receiving the official audio message.
