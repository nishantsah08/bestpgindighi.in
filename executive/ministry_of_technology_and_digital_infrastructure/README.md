# Ministry of Technology & Digital Infrastructure

This ministry is the engineering backbone of the system. It is responsible for building, maintaining, and securing the core technology platform upon which all other ministries operate.

## Departments

To ensure a clear separation of concerns and to manage risk effectively, the ministry is divided into two distinct departments:

### 1. Development Department
- **Mandate:** To innovate and build the future. This department is responsible for designing new architecture, developing shared services (MCPs), and creating the blueprints for new infrastructure. All work is done in a non-production environment.
- **Core Responsibilities**:
    - Development and maintenance of the real-time Contact Sync MCP.
    - Development and maintenance of the WhatsApp MCP.

### 2. Production Department
- **Mandate:** To ensure the stability, security, and reliability of the live system. This department is responsible for managing production servers, databases, CI/CD pipelines, and deploying validated blueprints from the Development Department.
- **Core Responsibilities**:
    - Monitor the operational status and uptime of all internal systems.
    - Monitor the health and performance of all external, third-party API integrations, including the WhatsApp Business API and the Mahadiscom web service.
