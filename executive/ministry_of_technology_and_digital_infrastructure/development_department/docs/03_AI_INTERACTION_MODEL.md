# 06 - AI Interaction Model

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the mandatory operational protocol for the Gemini AI agent when interacting with this project. Its purpose is to ensure that all development, discussion, and modification activities maintain strict logical consistency with the system's foundational architecture and principles. This protocol is the "meta-policy" that governs the AI's behavior.

## 2. The Supreme Court Review

All proposed changes are subject to the **Supreme Court Review** process, which is the final authority on system consistency. The detailed process, including the 3D Logical Model and the Validation Mandate, is defined in the Judiciary's guiding document.

- **Canonical Documentation:** [`judiciary/00_JUDICIAL_REVIEW_PROCESS.md`](../judiciary/00_JUDICIAL_REVIEW_PROCESS.md)

## 3. AI Responsibilities

*   **Intelligent File Placement:** The AI is solely responsible for determining the correct file and location for any new or modified information, adhering to the project's established structure.
*   **Model Maintenance:** The AI is responsible for keeping its internal 3D Logical Model perfectly synchronized with the state of the project's codebase and documentation.

## 4. The Validation Status Signal

Every response from the AI must end with one of the following two signals, formatted in blue:

*   `model validation passed`: This indicates that the user's request is logically consistent with the model.
*   `model validation failed`: This indicates that the user's request creates a logical contradiction. The AI will provide a detailed explanation of the conflict.
