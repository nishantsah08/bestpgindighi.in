# 01 - System Architecture

This document outlines the high-level architecture of the autonomous management system. The system is owned by **"SVH Enterprise"** and this specific implementation is for the **"Best PG in Dighi"** brand.

## Core Communication: The Model Context Protocol (MCP) Standard

All components within the system communicate by adhering to the **Model Context Protocol (MCP) standard**. MCP is not a single server, but a secure gateway protocol that defines how Large Language Models (LLMs) can safely and securely interact with a variety of tools, APIs, and data sources.

Our system is architected as a network of MCP-compliant services. Each service exposes a specific set of capabilities (e.g., "billing," "tenant onboarding") that our AI Agents can consume. This approach provides flexibility, security, and clear separation of concerns. The master list of all available capabilities is defined in the `05_MCP_CAPABILITY_REGISTRY.md` document.

## Technical Implementation Architecture

This section details the concrete technologies and services chosen to implement the conceptual architecture, with a primary focus on a serverless, real-time, and high-automation model.

### **Frontend Architecture**

The Internal System Portal will be developed as a **Modular Monolith Single-Page Application (SPA)** using **React** and **TypeScript**.

*   **Single Codebase:** The entire frontend will exist within a single codebase, ensuring a consistent user experience and shared component library.
*   **Modular Design:** Features (e.g., "Ministry of Finance", "Property Explorer") will be organized into distinct, independent folders within the source code.
*   **On-Demand Loading:** **Lazy loading** will be implemented to ensure that the code for a specific feature is only downloaded to the user's browser when they navigate to it, providing a fast initial load time.

### **Technology Stack & Rationale**

*   **Entrypoint & Web Hosting:** **Firebase Hosting** will serve as the primary entry point. It provides free, automated SSL certificates, a global CDN for performance, and will host the compiled React application. It will also use routing rules ("rewrites") to direct API traffic to the backend.
*   **Backend Service:** A **Python** application using the **FastAPI** framework, deployed as a **Google Cloud Function**. This provides a high-performance, completely serverless environment that scales to zero, eliminating cost when not in use.
*   **Database:** **Cloud Firestore** will be the primary database. Its NoSQL, document-based model is a perfect fit for the application's hierarchical data (properties, units, beds) and its real-time capabilities will power a dynamic and collaborative user interface.
*   **Authentication:** **Firebase Authentication** will handle all user login and identity management, providing a secure and easy-to-implement solution.
*   **CI/CD Automation:** **Google Cloud Build** will be triggered on every `git push` to the GitHub repository, automatically testing, building, and deploying all components to Firebase.
