# 01 - System Architecture

This document outlines the high-level architecture of the autonomous management system. The system is owned by **"SVH Enterprise"** and this specific implementation is for the **"Best PG in Dighi"** brand.

## Core Communication: The Model Context Protocol (MCP) Standard

All components within the system communicate by adhering to the **Model Context Protocol (MCP) standard**. MCP is not a single server, but a secure gateway protocol that defines how Large Language Models (LLMs) can safely and securely interact with a variety of tools, APIs, and data sources.

Our system is architected as a network of MCP-compliant services. Each service exposes a specific set of capabilities (e.g., "billing," "tenant onboarding") that our AI Agents can consume. This approach provides flexibility, security, and clear separation of concerns. The master list of all available capabilities is defined in the `05_MCP_CAPABILITY_REGISTRY.md` document.

## Technical Implementation Architecture

This section details the concrete technologies and services chosen to implement the conceptual architecture, with a primary focus on a zero-cost, high-automation model.

### **Technology Stack & Rationale**

*   **Entrypoint & Web Hosting:** **Firebase Hosting** will serve as the primary entry point. It provides free, automated SSL certificates, a global CDN for performance, and intelligent routing ("rewrites") to direct traffic to the appropriate backend service, all within its generous free tier. This replaces the need for a paid Load Balancer.
*   **Backend Service:** A **Python** application using the **FastAPI** framework, running on **Google Cloud Run**. This provides a high-performance, scalable, serverless environment that scales to zero, eliminating cost when not in use.
*   **Frontend Service:** A **React** application written in **TypeScript**, also running on **Google Cloud Run**. This provides a modern, secure, and maintainable platform for all web portals.
*   **Database:** A **PostgreSQL** database managed by **Supabase**. This provides a robust, relational database on a perpetual free tier, which is critical for data integrity and cost management.
*   **Mobile Applications:** Native Android applications will be written in **Kotlin**. The UI will be built with **Jetpack Compose**, with a fallback to traditional **XML layouts** if the provided development environment does not support it. Updates will be handled via a custom, mandatory self-update mechanism, with `.apk` files hosted on **Supabase Storage**.
*   **Infrastructure as Code:** The entire cloud infrastructure will be defined as code using **Terraform**. This ensures a repeatable, reliable, and automated setup process.
*   **CI/CD Automation:** **Google Cloud Build** will be triggered on every `git push` to the GitHub repository, automatically testing, building, and deploying all components.

### **Cost-Control & Retention Policies**

The architecture is designed to operate at a near-zero monthly cost.

*   **Primary Recurring Cost:** The only anticipated recurring charge is **~$0.20/month** for **Google Cloud DNS** to keep the domain name active.
*   **Docker Image Optimization:** To remain within the **Google Artifact Registry** free tier (0.5 GB), a multi-stage build process will be used to create minimal, production-only Docker images.
*   **Image Retention Policy:** A strict, automated retention policy will be enforced via Terraform:
    1.  The most recently deployed image will always be tagged `latest` and will be exempt from deletion.
    2.  A maximum of 9 other non-`latest` images will be retained.
    3.  Any non-`latest` image older than 30 days will be automatically deleted.
