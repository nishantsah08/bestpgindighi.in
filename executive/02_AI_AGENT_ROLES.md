# 02 - AI Agent Roles

This document defines the specific roles and responsibilities of each AI agent within the system.

## Core Operational Philosophy: The Hunter and The Farmer

The human roles of Sales and Caretaker are the primary leads for the two ministries of the Executive Branch. Their responsibilities are clearly separated to ensure focus and accountability.

- **The Hunter (Sales Role):** Responsible for all commercial activities that drive business growth. This includes marketing, sales, negotiating contracts, and managing all financial aspects of the tenant relationship (billing, collections, adjustments, and final settlements).

- **The Farmer (Caretaker Role):** Responsible for retaining tenants and ensuring a high-quality living experience. This includes managing the physical property, responding to maintenance requests, handling on-site issues, and ensuring the property is secure and well-maintained.
