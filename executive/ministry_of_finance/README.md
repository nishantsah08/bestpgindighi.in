# Ministry of Finance

## 1. Mandate

This Ministry is responsible for the complete financial integrity of the autonomous business system. Its primary mandate is to ensure all financial transactions (both revenue and expenses) are recorded with absolute certainty and that all financial statements are accurate and available in real-time.

## 2. Core Responsibilities

- **Expense Management:** To process all expense claims submitted by the Owner via the designated WhatsApp workflow, ensuring each transaction is correctly categorized and filed.
- **Revenue Recognition:** To record all manually reported revenue (rent payments) from the CEO and Sales team, ensuring data integrity.
- **Financial Reporting:** To maintain and present the core financial statements of the business (Profit & Loss, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow) via the Internal System Portal.
- **Inventory Management:** To dynamically track all physical inventory acquired through business expenses.

## 3. Primary Agent

The work of this Ministry is carried out by the **Financial AI Agent**. This agent is responsible for executing all the conversational workflows, data processing, and ledger entries required to fulfill the ministry's mandate.

## 4. Technical Implementation

The Financial AI Agent receives all external communications via a secure webhook from the official **WhatsApp Business API**. Upon receiving a message, it translates the data from the API's format into the internal **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** to begin its processing workflow. All internal actions are handled via MCP.
