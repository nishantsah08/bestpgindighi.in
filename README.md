# The Autonomous PG Management System

## Overview

This repository contains the complete design and future implementation of an autonomous management system for the "Best PG in Dighi" brand, owned by "SVH Enterprise".

The system is designed using a "government" model to ensure a robust separation of powers, clear process ownership, and a high degree of automation.

## Important Note on the `bestpgindighi-ai` Directory

The `bestpgindighi-ai/` directory located in the project root is a **reference clone** of a previous implementation. It is **not** part of the active development of this autonomous system.

*   **DO NOT** load any context from this directory.
*   **DO NOT** commit or upload its contents to version control.
*   It exists solely for historical reference and comparison.

The directory has been added to `.gitignore` to prevent accidental inclusion in commits.

## Project Status

The project is currently in the **design and scaffolding phase**. The complete architecture, operational workflows, and foundational principles have been documented. The project's directory structure is in place, ready for implementation.

## Getting Started
