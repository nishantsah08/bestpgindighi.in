# Website Audit Changelog

## Audit Date: August 6, 2025

### Broken Link Detection (Puppeteer)

*   **Status:** Completed.
*   **Findings:** No broken internal or external links (4xx/5xx) were detected by the Puppeteer-based recursive crawl of `https://bestpg-public.web.app/`.
*   **Fixed Broken Links (Before â†’ After):** No broken links were found, so no fixes were required in this category.

### Navigation and Link Checking (Puppeteer)

*   **Status:** Completed.
*   **Findings:** All primary navigation links (Home, Rooms & Pricing, Facilities, Location & Contact) are working correctly for both desktop and mobile viewports. No 404 errors, blank screens, or URL mismatches were detected during simulated user clicks.
*   **Report:** See `navigation-audit-puppeteer.txt` for the full Puppeteer output.

### Lighthouse Performance & SEO Audit

*   **Status:** Failed to generate reports due to persistent environment/permission issues on the VPS.
*   **Action Required:** Manual Lighthouse audit is needed. Please provide the JSON report content for further analysis and optimization.

### Repairs and Improvements Implemented (Based on previous development work):

*   **Canonical Tags:** Added to all HTML pages.
*   **Internal Navigation Links:** All internal navigation links updated to use clean URLs.
*   **Firebase Redirects:** 301 redirects configured in `firebase.json` for old `.html` URLs to clean URLs.
*   **Custom 404 Page:** `404.html` created and configured in `firebase.json`.
*   **Basic SEO Files:** `sitemap.xml` and `robots.txt` generated.
*   **Image Integration & Optimization:**
    *   Images have been integrated into relevant HTML pages.
    *   Descriptive `alt` attributes have been added to image tags based on provided context.
    *   `loading="lazy"` has been applied to images for performance optimization.
    *   Basic CSS styling for images has been added for consistent appearance.
*   **Content Enhancement:**
    *   `rooms.html`: Detailed descriptions for each pricing tier (balcony, upper bunk, standard single) added.
    *   `facilities.html`: Expanded descriptions for Kitchen & Dining, Laundry & Cleaning, Toilets & Bathrooms, Safety & Security, and Parking sections.
    *   `contact.html`: Social media link placeholders added (requires actual URLs and icons).
*   **Accessibility Fixes:** No specific accessibility issues (e.g., contrast) could be identified or fixed without a Lighthouse audit. This remains a pending manual verification point.
