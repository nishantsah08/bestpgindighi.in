### Plan: Deploying `index.html` to Firebase Hosting

**Objective:** To serve the `index.html` file using Firebase Hosting, leveraging its global CDN and secure hosting capabilities.

**Approach:**

1.  **Firebase Project & CLI Setup:**
    *   Ensure the Firebase project is correctly set up and linked to your Google Cloud project.
    *   Verify the Firebase CLI is installed and authenticated on the system where the deployment will occur.

2.  **Firebase Hosting Initialization:**
    *   Initialize Firebase Hosting within the project directory. This will create a `firebase.json` configuration file and a `public` directory (or a directory of your choice).

3.  **`index.html` Placement:**
    *   Move or copy the `index.html` file from `src/public_website/index.html` into the designated Firebase Hosting public directory (e.g., `public/`).

4.  **`firebase.json` Configuration:**
    *   Configure `firebase.json` to specify the correct `public` directory and ensure `index.html` is served as the default file.

5.  **Deployment:**
    *   Execute the Firebase Hosting deployment command to upload the `index.html` and any other static assets to Firebase.

### Requirements for the Expert:

To successfully implement this plan, I would need the expert to confirm or provide the following:

1.  **Firebase Project ID:** The exact Firebase Project ID to which `index.html` should be deployed.
2.  **Firebase CLI Access:** Confirmation that the Firebase CLI is installed and that I (or the system running the commands) have the necessary authentication to deploy to the specified Firebase project. This typically involves running `firebase login`.
3.  **Desired Hosting Directory:** Confirm the exact path within the project where `index.html` should reside for Firebase Hosting. By default, Firebase CLI initializes a `public/` directory, but this can be customized. For example, should it be `public/index.html` or `firebase_hosting/index.html`?
4.  **Existing `firebase.json`:** If a `firebase.json` file already exists, I would need its content to ensure I don't overwrite or conflict with existing configurations.

Once these requirements are met, I can proceed with the detailed steps to configure and deploy.
