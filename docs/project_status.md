# Project Status: End of Day - July 24, 2025

**Objective:** To deploy the initial "Walking Skeleton" of the application.

**Current Status:**
*   We have a complete and documented plan for all applications and the internal portal.
*   We have a CI/CD pipeline configured in GitHub Actions that is intended to automatically build, push, and deploy our backend and frontend applications.
*   We have encountered and worked through a series of deployment errors, progressively solving issues related to:
    1.  IAM Permissions (Workload Identity Federation)
    2.  Terraform Configuration (Resource creation, dependency cycles)
    3.  Application Dependencies (Node.js and Python)
    4.  File Structure (React project setup)
*   **The final remaining issue** is a container startup error on Google Cloud Run for the backend service.

**Last Action Taken:**
*   I have replaced the problematic, hand-written `Dockerfile` for the backend with a new, community-vetted, best-practice template.
*   This change has been pushed to the `main` branch, and the CI/CD pipeline is currently running.

**Next Step:**
*   When we resume, our first action will be to check the result of the currently running GitHub Actions workflow.
*   If it has succeeded, we will proceed to verify the deployment and move on to Phase 2 of development.
*   If it has failed, we will analyze the new logs to diagnose and resolve the final issue.
