# Project Status: July 28, 2025

**Objective:** Phase 1: Deploy the initial "Walking Skeleton" of the application.

**Status: COMPLETE**

*   **Backend Service:** Deployed to **Google Cloud Functions**.
*   **Internal Dashboard:** Deployed to **Firebase Hosting**.
*   **Public Website:** Successfully deployed to Firebase Hosting. The website is live and accessible.

All three components of the initial "Walking Skeleton" are now operational.

**Next Steps (Phase 2): Core Business Logic Implementation**

We will now begin implementing the core business logic as defined in the project's planning documents. The immediate next steps are:

1.  **Review the Business Operations Model:** Analyze `docs/05_BUSINESS_OPERATIONS_MODEL.md` to identify the first set of features to implement.
2.  **Propose an Implementation Plan:** Create a detailed plan for implementing the first set of features, including any necessary database schema changes and API endpoint definitions.
3.  **Begin Development:** Once the plan is approved, start development on the backend and frontend to implement the new features.
