## Current Objective: Public Website Transformation

**Branch:** `public_website_development` (Proposed for this work)

**Goal:** To transform the existing public website into a comprehensive, aesthetically pleasing, and highly optimized marketing platform. This involves implementing a detailed SEO strategy, creating new dedicated landing pages, and enhancing existing content to effectively attract and inform potential tenants, highlight the property's unique selling points, and drive inquiries.

**Key Activities:**
*   **Phase 1: Core Content & Branding:**
    *   Develop/enhance `index.html`, `rooms.html`, `facilities.html`, and `contact.html` with high-quality content, imagery, and clear navigation.
    *   Apply established branding and design system principles.
*   **Phase 2: SEO Optimization & Technical Foundations:**
    *   Implement a comprehensive SEO strategy including keyword integration (core, targeted expansion for AIT students, Tata Communications employees, boys hostel), content strategy for new landing pages (`boys-hostel-dighi.html`, `ait-student-housing.html`, `tcl-employee-accommodation.html`, `student-housing.html`).
    *   Focus on on-page SEO (meta tags, headings, image optimization, content quality).
    *   Implement technical SEO (clean URL structure, 301 redirects, schema markup, page speed, mobile-first optimization, HTTPS, sitemap, robots.txt, click-to-call).
