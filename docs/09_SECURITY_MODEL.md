# 09 - Security Model

This document outlines the security model for the entire autonomous management system, with a specific focus on securing the distributed network of Model Context Protocol (MCP) services.

## 1. Core Principles

- **Least Privilege:** All components (AI agents, applications, services) must operate with the minimum level of privilege necessary to perform their function.
- **Defense in Depth:** Security is applied in layers. A failure in one layer should be caught by the next.
- **Zero Trust:** No component is trusted by default. All interactions must be authenticated and authorized.
- **Secure by Design:** Security is not an afterthought; it is a foundational component of the system architecture.

## 2. Authentication

All requests to any MCP service endpoint must be authenticated.

- **Method:** We will use OAuth 2.0 with the Client Credentials flow for service-to-service communication.
- **Identity Provider:** A central, dedicated Authentication Service (conforming to the MCP standard) will be responsible for issuing time-limited access tokens.
- **Token Validation:** Every MCP service is responsible for validating the access token on every incoming request.

## 3. Authorization

Authentication confirms *who* is making the request; authorization confirms *what* they are allowed to do.

- **Capability-Based Access Control:** Authorization is managed at the capability level.
- **Access Control Lists (ACLs):** Each capability is protected by an ACL, which is defined in the `05_MCP_CAPABILITY_REGISTRY.md`. The ACL specifies exactly which AI agents or application roles are permitted to invoke the capability.
- **Enforcement:** The gateway of each MCP service is responsible for enforcing the ACL for its registered capabilities.

## 4. Secret Management

- **Secrets Vault:** All sensitive information (API keys, client secrets, database credentials) will be stored in a centralized, encrypted secrets vault (e.g., HashiCorp Vault or a cloud provider's equivalent).
- **No Hardcoded Secrets:** Secrets must never be stored in source code, configuration files, or environment variables.
- **Dynamic Secrets:** Where possible, we will use dynamic secrets that are generated on-demand and have a short lifespan.

## 5. Network Security

- **TLS Everywhere:** All communication between system components must be encrypted using TLS 1.2 or higher.
- **Firewall Rules:** Strict firewall rules will be in place to limit traffic between services to only what is explicitly required.

## 6. Securing Inbound Webhooks

- **Signature Validation:** All inbound webhooks (e.g., from the WhatsApp Business API) must be secured by validating the request signature.
- **Payload Integrity:** The signature validation process ensures that the request payload has not been tampered with.

## 7. Auditing & Monitoring

- **Audit Logs:** Every request to an MCP service, whether successful or failed, will be logged.
- **Vigilance AI:** The Vigilance AI is responsible for continuously monitoring these audit logs for suspicious activity.

## 7. Executive Action Auditing

- All judicial decisions made by the CEO via the Internal System Portal will be captured in a dedicated, immutable audit log. The log will record the CEO's identity, the case ID, the timestamp, and the exact action taken (Approve, Reject, Modify).

## 8. Mitigating Intent Interpretation Risks

- **The Risk of Ambiguity:** An intent-based system, by its nature, introduces the risk that the AI may misinterpret a user's ambiguous natural language, leading to unintended actions.
- **Primary Control (The AI Confirmation Loop):** The mandatory **AI Confirmation Loop**, as defined in Constitution Amendment III, is the primary security control to mitigate this risk. It transforms an ambiguous user request into an unambiguous, structured proposal that requires explicit user sign-off.
- **Auditability:** The user's final, affirmative confirmation serves as the definitive, auditable record of their authorization for the action, shifting the final accountability to the user and protecting the system from claims of misinterpretation.

### 8.1. Document Forgery Risk
- **The Risk:** A user could submit a digitally altered or fraudulent receipt or invoice to the SOC for expense processing.
- **Control Clarification:** The AI's role is limited to **data extraction**, not **document authentication**. The system will not attempt to detect forgeries. The **AI Confirmation Loop** remains the primary control. By confirming the transaction, the CEO attests to the legitimacy of the source document and accepts full responsibility for the expense, as per Constitution Amendment IV.
