# 09 - Security Model

This document outlines the security model for the entire autonomous management system, with a specific focus on securing the distributed network of Model Context Protocol (MCP) services.

## 1. Core Principles

- **Least Privilege:** All components (AI agents, applications, services) must operate with the minimum level of privilege necessary to perform their function.
- **Defense in Depth:** Security is applied in layers. A failure in one layer should be caught by the next.
- **Zero Trust:** No component is trusted by default. All interactions must be authenticated and authorized.
- **Secure by Design:** Security is not an afterthought; it is a foundational component of the system architecture.

## 2. Authentication

All requests to any MCP service endpoint must be authenticated.

- **Method:** We will use OAuth 2.0 with the Client Credentials flow for service-to-service communication.
- **Identity Provider:** A central, dedicated Authentication Service (conforming to the MCP standard) will be responsible for issuing time-limited access tokens.
- **Token Validation:** Every MCP service is responsible for validating the access token on every incoming request.

## 3. Authorization

Authentication confirms *who* is making the request; authorization confirms *what* they are allowed to do.

- **Capability-Based Access Control:** Authorization is managed at the capability level.
- **Access Control Lists (ACLs):** Each capability is protected by an ACL, which is defined in the `05_MCP_CAPABILITY_REGISTRY.md`. The ACL specifies exactly which AI agents or application roles are permitted to invoke the capability.
- **Enforcement:** The gateway of each MCP service is responsible for enforcing the ACL for its registered capabilities.

## 4. Secret Management

- **Secrets Vault:** All sensitive information (API keys, client secrets, database credentials) will be stored in a centralized, encrypted secrets vault (e.g., HashiCorp Vault or a cloud provider's equivalent).
- **No Hardcoded Secrets:** Secrets must never be stored in source code, configuration files, or environment variables.
- **Dynamic Secrets:** Where possible, we will use dynamic secrets that are generated on-demand and have a short lifespan.

## 5. Network Security

- **TLS Everywhere:** All communication between system components must be encrypted using TLS 1.2 or higher.
- **Firewall Rules:** Strict firewall rules will be in place to limit traffic between services to only what is explicitly required.

## 6. Securing Inbound Webhooks

- **Signature Validation:** All inbound webhooks (e.g., from the WhatsApp Business API) must be secured by validating the request signature.
- **Payload Integrity:** The signature validation process ensures that the request payload has not been tampered with.

## 7. Auditing & Monitoring

- **Audit Logs:** Every request to an MCP service, whether successful or failed, will be logged.
- **Vigilance AI:** The Vigilance AI is responsible for continuously monitoring these audit logs for suspicious activity.

## 7. Executive Action Auditing

- All judicial decisions made by the CEO via the Internal System Portal will be captured in a dedicated, immutable audit log. The log will record the CEO's identity, the case ID, the timestamp, and the exact action taken (Approve, Reject, Modify).
