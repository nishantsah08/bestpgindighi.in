# 07 - Disaster Recovery Plan

This document outlines the procedures for recovering from a catastrophic system failure.

## 1. Core Principle: Recovery Time Objective (RTO)

Our primary goal is to restore critical, tenant-facing services within a defined Recovery Time Objective. The RTO for this system is **4 hours**.

## 2. Firebase Firestore Backup and Restore

- **Backup Strategy:** Automated, daily backups of the entire Firestore database will be configured using the Firebase console.
- **Backup Retention:** Backups will be retained for a minimum of 30 days.
- **Restore Procedure:** In the event of data corruption or loss, the on-call engineer will manually initiate a point-in-time restore from the last known good backup.

## 3. Service Redeployment

- **Infrastructure as Code:** All MCP services will be defined using an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) framework (e.g., Terraform).
- **Redeployment:** In the event of a service or infrastructure failure, the on-call engineer will redeploy the affected services from the IaC templates.

## 4. Annual Testing

- The disaster recovery plan will be tested annually in a non-production environment to ensure its effectiveness and to train personnel on the procedures.
