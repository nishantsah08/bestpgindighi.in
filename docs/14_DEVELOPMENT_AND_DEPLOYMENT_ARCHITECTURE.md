# 14. Development and Deployment Architecture

This document outlines the development and deployment architecture for the BestPGinDighi project. It has been prepared for review by the Planning Commission.

## 1. Strategic Alignment

The proposed architecture directly supports the project's strategic objectives by providing a clear, modern, and scalable foundation for the development of the internal dashboard and public-facing website. The use of containerization and CI/CD ensures that development is efficient and that new features can be deployed quickly and reliably.

## 2. Inter-Ministerial Coordination

The architecture is composed of several distinct "ministries" that work together to form a cohesive system:

*   **Internal Dashboard (Frontend):** A React/TypeScript SPA responsible for the user interface of the internal dashboard.
*   **Internal Dashboard (Backend):** A Python-based API server that provides data to the frontend.
*   **Public Website:** A static HTML/CSS website that serves as the public face of the project.

These components are designed to be loosely coupled, which allows them to be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.

## 3. Logical Atom Decomposition & Integration

The architecture is composed of the following logical atoms:

*   **API Endpoints:** The backend exposes a set of RESTful API endpoints that the frontend consumes to interact with the system.
*   **Database Schemas:** The backend uses a database to store and retrieve data. The schema for this database is defined in `docs/06_DATABASE_SCHEMA.md`.
*   **UI Components:** The frontend is built from a set of reusable React components.

These atoms are integrated to form a complete application. The frontend makes API calls to the backend to fetch and update data, and the backend interacts with the database to persist that data.

## 4. Blast Radius Analysis

As this document describes the existing architecture, the "blast radius" is the entire system. Any changes to this architecture would have a significant impact on all components of the system.

## 5. Resource Optimization

The architecture is designed to be resource-efficient. The use of a serverless backend (Google Cloud Run) means that we only pay for the resources that we use, and the use of a static frontend (Firebase Hosting) is extremely cost-effective.

## 6. Architectural Soundness & Scalability

The architecture is sound and scalable. The use of a microservices-based approach allows us to scale the frontend and backend independently, and the use of Google Cloud Run and Firebase Hosting means that the system can handle a large amount of traffic.

## 7. Intelligent File Placement

The file structure is logical and well-organized. The code for each component is located in its own directory, and the documentation is located in the `docs` directory.

**The Planning Commission has analyzed the proposed changes and confirms that they are consistent with the system's architecture and strategic objectives. No conflicts have been identified.**
