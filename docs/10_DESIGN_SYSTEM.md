# 10 - Brand & Design System

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-07-22

## 1. Core Principle: Clarity & Speed

Every design choice will be optimized for readability, intuitive use, and fast loading times. We will avoid anything that is purely decorative and does not serve a functional purpose. The user's reading experience is the highest priority.

## 2. Color Palette

- **Primary:** `Deep Blue (#005A9C)` - Used for navigation, headers, and key structural elements.
- **Accent:** `Vibrant Orange (#FF7F00)` - Used for all primary buttons and calls-to-action.
- **Backgrounds:** `White (#FFFFFF)` & `Light Gray (#F5F5F5)`.
- **Text:** `Dark Gray (#333333)`.

## 3. Typography

- **Headings:** `Montserrat` (from Google Fonts).
- **Body Text:** `Lato` (from Google Fonts).
- **Hierarchy:** A clear and consistent size and weight scale will be used to ensure the information hierarchy is instantly understandable.

## 4. Layout & Spacing

- **Grid-Based:** All layouts will be built on a standard 12-column grid.
- **Whitespace:** Generous whitespace will be used around all text and UI elements to reduce complexity and improve focus.

## 5. Interactivity & Animation

- **Purposeful Animation Only:** Animations will be subtle, fast, and used exclusively to provide feedback or guide the user (e.g., button hover states, smooth fade-ins).
- **No Distractions:** There will be no purely decorative or "jazzy" animations.

## 6. Iconography

- **Style:** A single, consistent icon set will be used: **Material Symbols (Outlined)** from Google.
