# 08 - System Monitoring and Alerting Plan

This document outlines the plan for monitoring the health, performance, and security of the autonomous management system and its network of MCP-compliant services.

## 1. Monitoring Philosophy

Our monitoring strategy is based on the four "Golden Signals" of monitoring:

1.  **Latency:** The time it takes to service a request.
2.  **Traffic:** The amount of demand being placed on the system.
3.  **Errors:** The rate of requests that fail.
4.  **Saturation:** How "full" the service is (e.g., CPU, memory usage).

## 2. Monitoring Components

- **Metrics Collection:** A centralized time-series database (e.g., Prometheus) will be used to collect metrics from all MCP services.
- **Log Aggregation:** A centralized log aggregation system (e.g., ELK stack or a cloud provider's equivalent) will be used to collect and analyze logs from all components.
- **Dashboards:** We will use a visualization tool (e.g., Grafana) to build dashboards that provide a real-time view of the system's health based on the collected metrics and logs.
- **Alerting:** An alerting manager (e.g., Alertmanager) will be used to trigger alerts based on predefined rules.

## 3. Key Metrics to Monitor (Per MCP Service)

## 3. Key Metrics to Monitor (Per MCP Service)

### External API Webhooks
- **Request Rate:** Requests per second.
- **Error Rate:** 4xx and 5xx errors.
- **Latency:** Time to process and queue the incoming message.

### Application Metrics
- **Request Rate:** Requests per second (by capability).
- **Error Rate:** Percentage of failed requests (by capability and error type).
- **Request Latency:** 95th and 99th percentile latency for each capability.
- **Queue Depth:** (If applicable) The number of items in any processing queues.

### System Metrics
- **CPU Utilization:** Percentage of CPU in use.
- **Memory Usage:** Amount of memory consumed.
- **Disk I/O:** Read/write operations per second.
- **Network I/O:** Bytes sent/received per second.

## 4. Alerting Strategy

Alerts will be categorized into two levels:

1.  **Warning (Level 1):** Indicates a potential problem that requires investigation but is not yet critical. These will be sent to a dedicated chat channel.
    - *Example:* CPU utilization exceeds 70% for 5 minutes.
    - *Example:* 99th percentile latency for a key capability exceeds 500ms.

2.  **Critical (Level 2):** Indicates a serious, service-impacting problem that requires immediate attention. These will trigger a page to the on-call engineer.
    - *Example:* Error rate for any service exceeds 5% over a 1-minute period.
    - *Example:* A key service is unresponsive (health check failing).

## 5. Responsible Parties

- **Ministry of Technology & Digital Infrastructure:** Responsible for maintaining the monitoring and alerting infrastructure.
- **Auditor AI:** Responsible for analyzing long-term trends in the monitoring data to identify performance bottlenecks and cost-saving opportunities.
- **Vigilance AI:** Responsible for monitoring security-related logs and metrics for signs of an attack.
