# 05 - Business Operations Model

This document details key operational workflows and discretionary processes.

## Complaint Escalation Hierarchy

This defines the path for resolving all complaints to ensure timely and appropriate handling.

1.  **Intake:** An Intake AI performs intent classification on all incoming complaints, regardless of channel (WhatsApp, App, etc.).
2.  **Initial Assignment (Automated):**
    *   If the intent is related to the physical property or on-site experience (e.g., maintenance, cleaning, noise), the complaint is assigned to the **Caretaker**.
    *   If the intent is related to financial or contractual matters (e.g., billing, rent, agreements), the complaint is assigned to **Sales**.
3.  **Manual Escalation Path:**
    *   The initial owner (Caretaker or Sales) attempts to resolve the issue.
    *   If they cannot, they can escalate it. A Caretaker-escalated issue goes to Sales.
    *   If Sales cannot resolve an issue (either originally assigned or escalated), they can escalate it to the **CEO**.
4.  **Staff Complaints:** Any complaint originating from a staff member (Caretaker or Sales) is assigned directly to the **CEO**.

## Discretionary Actions

Certain actions are not fully automated and require manual judgment from a specific, authorized role.

*   **Financial Adjustments:**
    *   **Action:** Creating a non-cash credit/debit adjustment on a tenant's bill.
    *   **Authorized Role:** Sales.
    *   **Process:** The Sales role manually initiates the adjustment via the Admin Portal. The system then automatically applies this adjustment to the next billing cycle.

*   **Damage Assessment & Fees:**
    *   **Action:** Assessing the cost of damages during tenant offboarding.
    *   **Authorized Role:** Sales.
    *   **Process:** The Caretaker provides photographic/audio evidence. The Sales role reviews the evidence and manually inputs the final damage fee into the system.
