# 05 - Business Operations Model

This document outlines the core operational logic for the business, focusing on the customer lifecycle from onboarding to offboarding.

## 1. Tenant Onboarding & Compliance

The onboarding process is a structured workflow to ensure all financial and legal prerequisites are met before a tenancy officially begins.

- **Move-In & Initial Setup:** Upon arrival, the caretaker provides the tenant with keys and room essentials. Immediately, the tenant receives a link to the online **Police Verification Form**, which they must complete on the spot.
- **Rule Book Distribution:** Once the police verification is submitted, the **Rule Book / Code of Conduct** is automatically sent to the tenant via WhatsApp.
- **Rent Agreement:** The final legal step is the e-signing of the rent agreement. This is only initiated after the **full first month's rent AND the full security deposit** have been collected. The cost of the e-sign service is added to the tenant's next bill.

## 2. Initial Payment & Financial Flexibility

The system is designed to be flexible while managing financial risk.

- **Ideal Scenario:** The booking is secured by collecting the full first month's rent and the full security deposit in advance.
- **Standard Flexibility:** If the full deposit cannot be paid upfront, the system allows the collection of the full first month's rent to secure the booking. The deposit can then be paid in installments, with the full amount due by the 5th of the following month.
- **Short-Term Holds:** In exceptional cases, the Sales team has the discretion to hold a booking for a short period with a minimum advance payment (e.g., ₹2000 for 1 day, ₹3000 for 2 days). The full rent must be paid within this hold period.

## 3. Monthly Billing & Collections

The billing process is automated and designed for clarity and consistency.

- **Billing Cycle:** Bills are generated on the last day of each month and are due by the 5th of the following month.
- **Proration:** For tenants who join mid-month, the first month's rent is collected in full. A credit for the unused days is automatically applied to the second month's bill.
- **Rent Refunds:** Rent payments are non-refundable.
- **Bill Composition:** Bills are itemized and can include base rent, electricity, fines, adjustments, discounts, and any outstanding balance from previous months.
- **Communication:** All bills and payment reminders are delivered exclusively via WhatsApp.

## 4. Late Fees & Escalation

The system enforces a clear and fair process for late payments.

- **Grace Period:** A 5-day grace period is provided after the due date.
- **Late Fee:** A flat fee of ₹100 per day is applied from the 6th to the 10th of the month, capped at a maximum of ₹500.
- **Escalation:** A multi-level escalation process (Caretaker -> Sales -> CEO) is automatically triggered if payment is not received by the 11th of the month.
