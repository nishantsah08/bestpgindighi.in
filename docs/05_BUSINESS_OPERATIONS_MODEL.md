# 05 - Business Operations Model

This document outlines the core operational logic for the business, focusing on the customer lifecycle from onboarding to offboarding.

## 1. Tenant Onboarding & Compliance

The onboarding process is a structured workflow to ensure all financial and legal prerequisites are met before a tenancy officially begins.

- **Move-In & Initial Setup:** Upon arrival, the caretaker provides the tenant with keys and room essentials. Immediately, the tenant receives a link to the online **Police Verification Form**, which they must complete on the spot.
- **Rule Book Distribution:** Once the police verification is submitted, the **Rule Book / Code of Conduct** is automatically sent to the tenant via WhatsApp.
- **Rent Agreement:** The final legal step is the e-signing of the rent agreement. This is only initiated after the **full first month's rent AND the full security deposit** have been collected. The cost of the e-sign service is added to the tenant's next bill.

## 2. Initial Payment & Financial Flexibility

The system is designed to be flexible while managing financial risk.

- **Ideal Scenario:** The booking is secured by collecting the full first month's rent and the full security deposit in advance.
- **Standard Flexibility:** If the full deposit cannot be paid upfront, the system allows the collection of the full first month's rent to secure the booking. The deposit can then be paid in installments, with the full amount due by the 5th of the following month.
- **Short-Term Holds:** In exceptional cases, the Sales team has the discretion to hold a booking for a short period with a minimum advance payment (e.g., ₹2000 for 1 day, ₹3000 for 2 days). The full rent must be paid within this hold period.

## 3. Monthly Billing & Collections

The billing process is automated and designed for clarity and consistency.

- **Billing Cycle:** Bills are generated on the last day of each month and are due by the 5th of the following month.
- **Proration:** For tenants who join mid-month, the first month's rent is collected in full. A credit for the unused days is automatically applied to the second month's bill.
- **Rent Refunds:** Rent payments are non-refundable.
- **Bill Composition:** Bills are itemized and can include base rent, electricity, fines, adjustments, discounts, and any outstanding balance from previous months.
- **Communication:** All bills and payment reminders are delivered exclusively via WhatsApp.

## 4. Late Fees & Escalation

The system enforces a clear and fair process for late payments.

- **Grace Period:** A 5-day grace period is provided after the due date.
- **Late Fee:** A flat fee of ₹100 per day is applied from the 6th to the 10th of the month, capped at a maximum of ₹500.
- **Escalation:** A multi-level escalation process (Caretaker -> Sales -> CEO) is automatically triggered if payment is not received by the 11th of the month.

## 5. SEO & GBL Review Flywheel

This process is designed to turn positive customer experiences into a sustainable marketing asset.

- **Trigger:** The process is initiated during the tenant off-boarding, specifically at the point of the manual security deposit refund.
- **Execution:** The CEO or a member of the Sales team, during the final conversation with the tenant, will personally request feedback.
- **Tooling:** Using the **"Generate GBL Review Link"** feature within the Sales or CEO Mobile App, the user will generate a direct link to the Google Business Listing review page.
- **Action:** The user sends this link directly to the tenant via WhatsApp, making it easy for the tenant to leave a review.
- **Goal:** To create a continuous cycle of positive reviews, which boosts local search ranking and attracts new, high-quality leads.

## 6. Vendor Information Management

This process outlines the simple, centralized method for managing all third-party vendor information.

- **Primary Tool:** The **CEO Mobile App** is the primary tool for adding and managing vendor data on the go.
- **Data Entry:** The CEO can create a profile for any new vendor, capturing contact details, service category, and financial information.
- **Interaction Logging:** All interactions, payments, and notes related to a vendor are logged against their profile, creating a complete activity history.
- **Document Storage:** Invoices, quotes, and contracts can be uploaded as files directly to a vendor's profile from the CEO's phone.
- **Central Repository:** The **Internal System Portal** provides a web-based view of the Vendor Directory, serving as a centralized database and a desktop alternative for the CEO.

## 7. Expense Filing Workflow

This process is designed for the Owner to report business expenses with accuracy and certainty, managed by the Financial AI.

- **Trigger:** The Owner sends a WhatsApp message, which can include text, an image of a receipt/invoice, or both, to the designated system number.
- **AI-led Clarification:** The Financial AI analyzes the message and initiates a single, consolidated clarification dialogue to confirm all necessary details (Vendor, Amount, Category, Capex Status, Inventory, Payment Method).
- **Irreversible Filing:** Once the Owner provides final confirmation, the expense is permanently filed in the general ledger.

## 8. Revenue Recognition Workflow

This process allows for the secure, manual recording of received rent payments.

- **Actors:** The CEO (via the Internal System Portal) and the Sales team (via WhatsApp).
- **Process:** The user provides the tenant identifier, the amount received, and the payment method (`Manual UPI` or `Manual Cash`).
- **Irreversible Confirmation:** The system requires a final, explicit confirmation from the user before permanently filing the revenue transaction in the general ledger. This action cannot be undone.
