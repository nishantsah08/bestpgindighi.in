# 11 - Data Governance Model

This document outlines the policies for managing the system's data, with a focus on the NoSQL structure of Firebase Firestore.

## 1. Schema Management

- **Canonical Schema:** The `docs/06_DATABASE_SCHEMA.md` document is the single source of truth for the data model.
- **Schema Evolution:** Any changes to the data model must be backward-compatible. Destructive changes (e.g., deleting a field) are prohibited. Instead, new fields should be added, and old fields should be marked as deprecated.
- **Validation:** All data written to the database must be validated against the canonical schema by the respective MCP service.

## 2. Data Lifecycle Management

- **Data Retention:** Data retention policies are defined in the `01_DATA_PRIVACY_POLICY.md`.
- **Archiving:** Tenant data will be moved to an archived state upon off-boarding.
- **Deletion:** Personally Identifiable Information (PII) will be securely deleted after the legally mandated retention period.

## 3. Data Quality

- **Data Owners:** Each data collection (e.g., `tenants`, `vendors`) has a designated owner (the relevant ministry) responsible for its quality and integrity.
- **Auditing:** The Auditor AI will periodically run data quality checks to identify and report anomalies.
