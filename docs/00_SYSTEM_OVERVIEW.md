# 00 - System Overview

## Philosophy

This system is designed as an autonomous, self-governing entity. It is owned by the legal entity **"SVH Enterprise"** and the first implementation is for the **"Best PG in Dighi"** brand (bestpgindighi.in).

It is modeled after a democratic government to ensure a clear separation of powers, robust oversight, and operational integrity.

## The Four Branches of Government

1.  **The Constitution (The "Why"):**
    *   Represents the core mission, values, and foundational goals of the business.
    *   It is the ultimate source of truth that guides all other components.

2.  **The Parliament (The "What"):**
    *   The legislative branch responsible for defining specific, enforceable business policies and operational rules (e.g., rent due dates, late fee policies).
    *   These policies are managed as code to ensure consistency and automated validation.

3.  **The Executive (The "How"):**
    *   The operational branch, powered by AI agents, that carries out the policies defined by the Parliament.
    *   It handles all day-to-day tasks, such as tenant onboarding, billing, and maintenance requests.

4.  **The Judiciary (The "Arbiter"):**
    *   An independent judicial branch responsible for resolving errors, disputes, and unforeseen edge cases that the Executive branch cannot handle on its own.

## Independent & Advisory Bodies

To ensure accountability and strategic growth, the system also includes:

*   **Independent Bodies:**
    *   **Auditor AI:** Proactively audits the performance and resource usage of the Executive departments.
    *   **Vigilance AI:** Monitors for internal and external security threats and integrity violations.
*   **Advisory Body:**
    *   **Strategy & Planning AI:** Analyzes long-term data and proposes future strategies to the human CEO.
