# Internal System Portal - User Guide

**For:** CEO, Power Users

### Philosophy: Total Information, Total Control

This web-based portal is the central nervous system of the entire operation, structured like a government to provide both high-level oversight and deep, departmental control. It is designed for use on a desktop computer.

### 1. The Dashboard

This is your primary, cross-ministry "Situation Room." It is a tabbed interface designed to show what needs attention and how the business is performing.

*   **Date Range Filter:** All data on the dashboard can be filtered by a master date range (e.g., "This Month").
*   **Action Items Tab:** The default view, focusing on immediate tasks. It contains:
    *   A **Pending Issues** widget with a total count and breakdown by category (Judiciary, Maintenance).
    *   A **Rent Status** widget showing collected vs. pending rent for the period.
    *   An **Issues Docket** listing all actionable items requiring your review.
*   **Performance Trends Tab:** This view shows key performance indicators (KPIs) with visual trend line charts:
    *   Widgets for Revenue, Occupancy Rate, Lead Conversion, etc., all showing trends over the selected period.

### 2. The Cabinet Secretary

Your direct line to the system's AI analyst. Use this chat-like interface to ask complex, natural language questions about your business data (e.g., "Compare electricity costs for Q1 vs Q2").

---

### 3. Ministry Pages (Departmental Headquarters)

Each ministry page is a dedicated dashboard for that specific business function, often with its own tabs for different departments.

*   **Ministry of Finance:** Manage all financial operations, including revenue, expenses, and the General Ledger.
*   **Property & Tenant Welfare:** The hub for the Tenant CRM and the Property/Bed inventory management system.
*   **Growth & Commerce:** Contains the detailed Sales Pipeline, lead management tools, and marketing reports.

---

### 4. Ministry of Technology

The engine room for configuring the system itself.

*   **The Parliament (Tab):** A powerful GUI for editing live business policies. The system reads the project's `.yaml` policy files and generates user-friendly forms to let you change the rules of the business without touching code.
*   **System Configuration (Tab):** The secure area for managing system-wide technical settings, most importantly the **API Keys and Integration Secrets** for third-party services like WhatsApp or payment gateways.
