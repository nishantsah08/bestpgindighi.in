*   **Automatic Watermark:** Every photo and video you take is automatically stamped with:
    *   A human-readable address (e.g., "Best PG in Dighi, Pune").
    *   The exact date and time.
*   **Workflow:**
    1.  Take a photo or record a video of an issue.
    2.  The app will immediately ask you to record a mandatory audio note to describe the problem.
    3.  You will select the location (e.g., "Room 5A," "Common Area - Kitchen").
    4.  Tap **[Create Issue]**. The evidence is uploaded, and a new issue is created in the system.
