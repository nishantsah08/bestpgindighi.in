# CEO Mobile App - User Guide

**For:** CEO

This guide explains how to use the CEO Mobile App for on-the-go management and strategic review.

## 1. Strategic Reviews: The AI Partnership (New!)

Once a month, the system's AI will act as your strategic advisor, presenting a data-driven proposal to optimize the marketing and lead nurturing strategy. This is the most important review you will conduct.

### Reviewing Monthly AI Strategy Proposals

*   **What it is:** On the first of each month, a new item will appear in the **"Strategic Proposals"** queue on your dashboard. This is the AI's proposal for the next month's lead nurturing strategy.
*   **How to interpret it:** The proposal will include a summary of the AI's findings and a clear recommendation. For example: *"Based on last month's data, I recommend we stop sending follow-up messages to leads with a score below 60 when vacancy is at 0%. This is projected to save â‚¹X in WhatsApp costs with minimal impact on conversions."*
*   **Your Role:** Your role is to use your business judgment to approve or reject the AI's proposed strategy. The existing strategy will continue until you approve a new one.

## 2. The System Operations Channel (SOC)

You have a direct line to the system's AI for day-to-day operations. You can perform key actions by sending simple messages or images to the dedicated SOC WhatsApp number.

### Filing Expenses
Send a text message or a photo of a receipt.

*   **You do:** Send a photo of a receipt to the SOC.
*   **The System asks:** "OK. I have extracted the following from the document: `vendor: Hotel Sagar, amount: 1250 INR, date: 2025-07-23`. Please confirm."
*   **You reply:** "Confirm"

### Querying Information
Ask the system questions about your business.

*   **You ask:** "How many vacant beds do we have right now?"
*   **The System replies:** "We currently have 6 vacant beds across all properties."

## 3. The Mobile App Dashboard

Your dashboard provides a real-time overview of the business, including the **Tenant Satisfaction Trend** chart and queues for routine approvals.

### Managing Vendors & Approvals
*   Use the **Vendor Directory** to manage vendor information.
*   Use the **Action Required** queue for routine approvals like utility bills and judicial cases.
