# Sales Mobile App - User Guide

**For:** Sales Team

This guide explains how to use the Sales Mobile App and the new AI-powered workflows.

## 1. AI-Powered Lead Scoring (New!)

To help you focus on the most promising inquiries, the system now uses AI to score every new lead.

*   **What it is:** When a new lead comes in, the AI analyzes it and assigns a **Lead Score** from 1 to 100.
*   **How it helps you:** Your **Action Required** queue is now automatically prioritized by this score. Leads with the highest score will appear at the top, allowing you to focus your time where it matters most.

## 2. The System Operations Channel (SOC)

You can record key financial transactions by sending simple, natural language messages to the dedicated SOC WhatsApp number.

### Recording Revenue
When a tenant makes a payment, simply tell the system about it.

*   **You say:** "The tenant in C-201 just paid 10000 rupees for their advance"
*   **The System asks:** "OK. I am about to record the following revenue: `amount: 10000 INR, description: Tenant advance, property: C-201`. Please confirm."
*   **You reply:** "Confirm"

## 3. The Mobile App

### Monitoring Workflows
The main screen of the app provides an overview of the lead and tenant onboarding pipelines. Use this to track progress and identify bottlenecks.

### Handling Action Items
Your **Action Required** queue is your primary workspace. It is now prioritized by the AI Lead Score.

### Requesting Reviews (GBL Flywheel)
