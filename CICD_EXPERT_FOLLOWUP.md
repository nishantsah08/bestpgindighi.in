# Follow-up Request for CI/CD Expert Review

**Date:** Wednesday, August 6, 2025

## 1. Summary

This is a follow-up to the previous request for expert review. The CI/CD workflow is still failing with the same `name unknown: Repository "cloud-run" not found` error, despite implementing all the recommended changes. This report details the exact steps taken and the results, which point to a fundamental issue with the `google-github-actions/auth` action.

## 2. Implemented Changes

Based on the expert's advice, the following changes were made to the `.github/workflows/deploy_to_cloud_run.yml` file:

1.  **Added Diagnostic Steps:** Two new steps, "Who am I?" and "Describe GAR repo," were added to the workflow to provide more insight into the authentication context.
2.  **Used Step Outputs:** The workflow was modified to use step outputs for the `IMAGE_URI` to avoid issues with environment variable expansion.
3.  **Explicit Docker Login:** An explicit `docker login` step was added to the workflow.
4.  **Corrected Project ID:** The `GCP_PROJECT_ID` secret was verified and corrected to `fir-bestpg`.
5.  **Targeted Multi-Region:** The workflow was updated to target the `asia` multi-region for the Artifact Registry.
6.  **Explicit Project ID in Auth:** The `project_id` was explicitly added to the `google-github-actions/auth` step.

## 3. The Root Cause: Persistent Authentication Failure

The diagnostic steps have revealed that the root cause of the problem is a persistent authentication failure. The "Who am I?" step consistently reports `No credentialed accounts`, even though the `google-github-actions/auth` step appears to complete successfully.

This indicates that the `gcloud` CLI session within the GitHub Actions runner is not being properly authenticated, which is why all subsequent `gcloud` commands are failing.

## 4. The Unanswered Question

The core question remains: **Why is the `google-github-actions/auth` action not creating a fully authenticated `gcloud` CLI session?**

## 5. Request to the Expert

Could you please review the latest workflow file and the logs to determine why the authentication is failing? Is there a known issue with the `google-github-actions/auth` action, or is there a subtle configuration error that is being missed?
