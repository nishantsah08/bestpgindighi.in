# Planning Commission Charter

All proposed changes to the system, whether architectural, design-oriented, or significant new features, must first undergo a **Planning Commission Review**. This body acts as the strategic foresight and resource alignment authority for the entire Republic (the project). Its mandate is to ensure that all development aligns with the overarching vision and long-term needs of the system, fostering prosperity and stability.

This review includes:
- **Strategic Alignment:** Ensuring the proposed change contributes to the long-term vision and strategic objectives of the Republic.
- **Inter-Ministerial Coordination:** Assessing the impact and ensuring seamless coordination across different "ministries" or business domains (e.g., Onboarding, Finance, Property Management).
- **Logical Atom Decomposition & Integration:** Breaking down the proposed change into its fundamental "logical atoms" (e.g., API endpoints, database schemas, UI components) and defining how these atoms link together to form a coherent and robust system.
- **Blast Radius Analysis:** A comprehensive analysis to identify all affected components and potential impacts across the system's 3D Logical Model (X-axis: business domains, Y-axis: layers of abstraction, Z-axis: event flows). This analysis must explicitly detail new, modified, and deleted files, as well as any changes to dependencies.
- **Resource Optimization:** Evaluating the proposed change for optimal resource utilization and adherence to cost-efficiency principles.
- **Architectural Soundness & Scalability:** Ensuring the proposed design adheres to principles of scalability, efficiency, maintainability, and overall architectural integrity.

Only upon successful completion and approval of the Planning Commission Review can a change proceed to the Supreme Court Review.

## AI Responsibilities

*   **Intelligent File Placement:** The AI is solely responsible for determining the correct file and location for any new or modified information, adhering to the project's established structure.
*   **Model Maintenance:** The AI is responsible for keeping its internal 3D Logical Model perfectly synchronized with the state of the project's codebase and documentation.

## Final Verification Statement

After every analysis of a proposed change, the Planning Commission must conclude its report with the following statement to signify that a full review has been completed and no conflicts have been found:

**"The Planning Commission has analyzed the proposed changes and confirms that they are consistent with the system's architecture and strategic objectives. No conflicts have been identified."**
