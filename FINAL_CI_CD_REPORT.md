# Final CI/CD Pipeline Report for Expert Review

**Date:** Wednesday, August 6, 2025

## 1. Objective

This document provides a complete and clean summary of the CI/CD pipeline configuration for an expert to review. The pipeline is intended to build a Docker image, push it to Google Artifact Registry (GAR), and deploy it to Google Cloud Run. Despite implementing a best-practice workflow, the final run is failing.

---

## 2. Verified GCP Setup

The following one-time setup commands have been successfully executed in the Google Cloud project `fir-bestpg` by the Project Owner:

*   **APIs Enabled:** `run.googleapis.com` and `artifactregistry.googleapis.com` are enabled.
*   **GAR Repository Created:** A Docker repository named `cloud-run` exists in the `asia-south1` location.
*   **IAM Permissions Granted:** The CI/CD service account (`firebase-adminsdk-fbsvc@fir-bestpg.iam.gserviceaccount.com`) has been granted the following roles at the project level:
    *   `roles/run.admin`
    *   `roles/artifactregistry.writer`
    *   `roles/iam.serviceAccountUser` (on the default compute service account)

---

## 3. Verified GitHub Setup

*   **Secret:** A repository secret named `GCP_SA_KEY` has been created. It contains the full JSON key for the `firebase-adminsdk-fbsvc@fir-bestpg.iam.gserviceaccount.com` service account.

## 4. Final Workflow File

This is the exact content of the `.github/workflows/cloud-run.yml` file that was executed:

```yaml
name: CI/CD â€¢ Cloud Run (walking-skeleton)

on:
  push:
    branches: [ walking-skeleton ]

env:
  PROJECT_ID: fir-bestpg
  REGION: asia-south1
  REPOSITORY: cloud-run
  SERVICE: api-backend
  # Tag with the commit SHA
  IMAGE: asia-south1-docker.pkg.dev/fir-bestpg/cloud-run/api-backend:${{ github.sha }}

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
      id-token: write

    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Auth to Google Cloud (JSON key)
        uses: google-github-actions/auth@v2
        with:
          credentials_json: ${{ secrets.GCP_SA_KEY }}

      - name: Setup gcloud
        uses: google-github-actions/setup-gcloud@v2
        with:
          version: '>= 471.0.0'

      - name: Configure Docker to use Artifact Registry
        run: gcloud auth configure-docker asia-south1-docker.pkg.dev --quiet

      - name: Build image
        run: |
          # Dockerfile is at repo root; context is '.'
          docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t "$IMAGE" .

      - name: Push image
        run: docker push "$IMAGE"

      - name: Deploy to Cloud Run
        run: |
          gcloud run deploy "$SERVICE" \
            --image "$IMAGE" \
            --region "$REGION" \
            --platform managed \
            --allow-unauthenticated \
            --port 8080 \
            --quiet

      - name: Output service URL
        run: |
          gcloud run services describe "$SERVICE" \
            --region "$REGION" \
            --format='value(status.url)'
```

## 5. The Final Error

The latest workflow run (`16772000827`) failed immediately. The GitHub Actions UI shows the failure, but attempting to view the logs results in a `log not found` error. This typically indicates a syntax error in the workflow file itself or a problem with the runner's initial setup.

## 6. Request to the Expert

Given that the GCP and GitHub setup appears to be correct, could you please perform a final review of the `cloud-run.yml` workflow file for any subtle syntax errors or logical issues that could be causing the run to fail before any steps can be logged? The combination of a successful setup and a `log not found` error is the final mystery to be solved.
