# Amendment III: On the Authority and Responsibility of AI Intent

This amendment establishes the legal and operational framework for the system's AI agents to interpret and act upon human-generated natural language.

## Article 1: Grant of Authority

The system's AI agents are hereby granted the constitutional authority to process, analyze, and interpret natural language communications from authorized users to determine their underlying intent. The system is empowered to use this derived intent as a primary trigger for initiating actions and workflows.

## Article 2: The Mandate of Confirmation

This authority is granted conditionally. For any derived intent that, if acted upon, would result in a financial transaction, a modification of the system's legal or policy documents, or a change to any user's data, the AI agent **must** engage in a mandatory **AI Confirmation Loop**.

The process for this loop is defined as:
1.  **Translate and Propose:** The AI agent will translate the user's natural language request into a structured, unambiguous data format that clearly states the proposed action and its parameters.
2.  **Present for Review:** The AI agent will present this structured data back to the user.
3.  **Await Explicit Confirmation:** The AI agent will take no further action until it receives a direct, affirmative confirmation from the user (e.g., "confirm," "yes," "proceed").

## Article 3: The Principle of Ultimate Responsibility

The system's AI agents are designated as responsible parties for their interpretations. However, the final legal and financial accountability for any action remains with the human user who provides the explicit confirmation as defined in Article 2. The confirmation step serves as the user's final, binding authorization for the action.

## Article 4: Supremacy of this Amendment

This amendment supersedes any previous policy, precedent, or operational model that mandated the use of rigid keywords, structured commands, or any other non-natural language interface for system interaction.
