# Amendment IV: On the Authority for Visual Data Interpretation

This amendment establishes the constitutional authority for the system's AI agents to interpret and process visual and document-based data.

## Article 1: Grant of Authority

The system's AI agents are hereby granted the authority to process and analyze visual media, including but not limited to images (`image/jpeg`, `image/png`) and document files (`application/pdf`). This authority includes the use of Optical Character Recognition (OCR), object detection, and other visual analysis techniques to extract structured data from these files.

## Article 2: Application to Financial Transactions

This authority explicitly extends to the financial domain. An AI agent may initiate a financial workflow, such as filing an expense, based on data extracted from a visual document. 

## Article 3: Conditional Authority and Confirmation Mandate

This authority is granted under the same conditions as natural language interpretation, as defined in **Amendment III**. Any financial transaction or data modification initiated as a result of visual data interpretation **must** be processed through the mandatory **AI Confirmation Loop**. The AI must present the extracted, structured data to the user for explicit, affirmative confirmation before any action is taken.

## Article 4: User Accountability for Authenticity

The AI's role is limited to data extraction. The human user who provides the final confirmation is solely accountable for verifying the authenticity and correctness of the source document and the transaction it represents.
