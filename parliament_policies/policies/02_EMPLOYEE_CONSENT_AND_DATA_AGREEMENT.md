## 1. Purpose

This document outlines the data processing activities related to your role and seeks your informed consent.

## 2. Data Collection & Analysis

As part of your role, all business-related and non-business-related calls made or received on your work-provided communication channel will be recorded and transcribed.

These transcripts will be analyzed by a secure, automated AI system for two specific purposes:

1.  **Operational Risk Management:** To identify trends in work-related topics (e.g., recurring maintenance issues) to help improve business operations.
2.  **Employee Well-being:** To identify trends in sentiment, stress indicators, and significant life events to help management provide support and ensure a healthy work environment.

## 3. Data Access & Confidentiality

- The raw call recordings and transcripts are stored securely.
- The output of the AI analysis is compiled into a confidential profile.
- **Access to this profile is strictly limited to the CEO only.**

## 4. Your Consent

By signing this document, you acknowledge that you have read and understood the above. You give your explicit consent for the recording and analysis of your communications for the specific purposes outlined.

This consent can be revoked at any time in writing, with the understanding that it may impact the ability of the system to perform its risk management functions.
