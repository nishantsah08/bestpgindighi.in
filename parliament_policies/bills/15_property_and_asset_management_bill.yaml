# Bill to Define and Manage Properties and Assets
version: 2.0 # Redesigned for scalable, database-driven management
policy_type: foundational

status: ACTIVE

description: >
  This bill establishes the policies for managing the business's physical properties and assets.
  It mandates that all property data be stored and managed in the system's database,
  not in this document. The canonical schema for this data is defined in the
  `21_property_data_management_bill.yaml`.

core_principles:
  - principle: "Database as Single Source of Truth"
    description: "All property, unit, and bed data must be stored in the designated Firestore collections. This document shall not contain property data."

  - principle: "Structured Data Management"
    description: "The creation, modification, and archiving of properties, units, and beds must be handled through authorized system APIs that enforce the schema defined in `21_property_data_management_bill.yaml`."
