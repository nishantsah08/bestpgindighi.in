  - type: 'semantic_versioning_with_data_link'
    description: 'This policy follows semantic versioning. Each tenant''s offboarding process must be linked to the policy version active when their notice period began.'
    data_impact: 'Changes to this policy require a new version. The system must be able to handle processes defined by previous versions for auditing.'

offboarding_process:
  - type: 'state_machine'
    description: 'The tenant offboarding process is managed as a state machine, with transitions triggered by specific events.'
    states:
      - 'active'
      - 'notice_period'
      - 'pending_damage_assessment'
      - 'pending_final_settlement'
      - 'completed'

core_principles:
  - 'The offboarding process is formally initiated when a tenant gives notice, as per the terms of their agreement.'
  - 'A damage assessment must be completed before the final financial settlement can be calculated.'
  - 'The final settlement must account for all outstanding financial obligations, including any `previous_outstanding` balance or `pending_deposit` payments, and may include a `discount_amount` as per Sales discretion.'
  - 'The final settlement, including the security deposit refund, is subject to the `Cash-Out Authorization` policy in the `13_financial_management_and_accounting_bill.yaml`, which requires exclusive CEO approval for the final transaction.'
