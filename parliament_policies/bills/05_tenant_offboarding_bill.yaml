    description: 'This policy follows semantic versioning. Each tenant''s offboarding process must be linked to the policy version active when their notice period began.'
    data_impact: 'Changes to this policy require a new version. The system must be able to handle processes defined by previous versions for auditing.'

  - 'parliament_policies/bills/02_monthly_billing_collections_bill.yaml'
  - 'parliament_policies/bills/08_security_deposit_management_bill.yaml'

offboarding_process:
  - type: 'state_machine'
    description: 'The tenant offboarding process is managed as a state machine, with transitions triggered by specific events.'
    states:
      - 'active'
      - 'notice_period'
      - 'pending_damage_assessment'
      - 'pending_final_settlement'
      - 'completed'

core_principles:
  - 'The offboarding process can be initiated in two ways:'
  - '1. Controlled Offboarding: A tenant gives notice as per the terms of their agreement.'
  - '2. Uncontrolled Offboarding: The Caretaker confirms that a bed has been reclaimed as per the eviction process in the `02_monthly_billing_collections_bill.yaml`.'
  - 'Upon initiation, the system will calculate the final dues.'
  - 'The final settlement, including any write-offs or refunds, will be sent to the CEO for final approval as per the `Cash-Out Authorization` policy.'
