  - 'A damage assessment must be completed before the final financial settlement can be calculated.'
  - 'The final settlement must account for all outstanding financial obligations, including any `previous_outstanding` balance or `pending_deposit` payments, and may include a `discount_amount` as per Sales discretion.'
  - 'The final settlement, including any damage charges and the final security deposit refund amount, must be approved by an authorized role defined in the parameters file.'
