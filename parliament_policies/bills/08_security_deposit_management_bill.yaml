  - description: 'This policy follows semantic versioning. Each tenant''s security deposit record must be linked to the policy version active during their tenancy.'

core_principles:
  - 'The security deposit can be paid in installments, with the terms defined in the parameters file.'

  - 'The conditions for deduction from the security deposit (e.g., for damages) are outlined in the parameters file and linked to the Tenant Offboarding policy.'
