core_principles:
  - 'The collection of the security deposit is governed by the rules in the Booking & Initial Payment Flexibility Policy, including rules for installment payments and deadlines.'
  - 'The system must clearly distinguish between a cash-out refund of a deposit and a non-cash credit adjustment.'
  - 'The conditions for deduction from the security deposit (e.g., for damages) are determined during the offboarding process and are linked to the Tenant Offboarding policy.'
  - 'Any outstanding deposit amount will be reflected as `pending_deposit` in the monthly billing cycle.'
