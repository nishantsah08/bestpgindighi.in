inbound_communication:
  - rule: "AI-Powered Intent Recognition and Routing for All Media Types"
    description: "All inbound messages and media files on the SOC will be processed by an AI service to determine user intent and extract relevant entities. This derived intent is the primary driver for all subsequent system actions."
    processing_flow:
      - "Step 1: Receive inbound communication (text, image, or document) from the SOC."
      - "Step 2: If the communication is text, submit it to the NLU service. If it is a media file, submit it to the OCR/NLU service."
      - "Step 3: Route the resulting structured intent object to the appropriate MCP (Ministerial Capability Platform) queue based on the classified intent (e.g., 'intent_file_expense_from_document' -> 'financial_ai_queue')."
      - "Step 4: For any intent classified as having financial, legal, or data-modification consequences, the receiving agent MUST initiate the mandatory 'AI Confirmation Loop' as defined in the Constitution before taking any action."
