      - "Step 3: If the message is not a financial transaction, analyze it for service-related keywords (including both maintenance and complaints)."
      - "Step 4: If the message is identified as a service request or complaint, route it exclusively to the Unified Service Request Workflow."
      - "Step 5: If the message is neither financial nor service-related, route it to the Sales Agent's interface."
