    description: >
      Tenant electricity bills are calculated based solely on sub-meter readings.

    cost_calculation:
      rate: 10
      unit: "INR per kWh"
      allocation: "Total flat cost is divided equally among the number of active occupants for the billing month."
    estimation_fallback:
      trigger: "A verified sub-meter reading is not available by the billing date (1st of the month)."
      logic: "The system will use the consumption from the same month of the previous year for that specific flat."
