      - 'Step 2: The call recording is automatically transcribed and analyzed.'
      - 'Step 3: A new lead profile is created with the extracted contact information.'
      - 'Step 4: The lead's data (e.g., inquiry content, source, time of day) is sent to the AI Lead Scoring model.'
      - 'Step 5: The model returns a Lead Score (1-100) which is saved to the lead's profile.'
      - 'Step 6: A new task is created for the Sales Agent, prioritized in their queue based on the Lead Score.'
      - 'Step 7: The system automatically sends a standardized WhatsApp message to the lead with property details.'

lead_nurturing_process:
  - description: 'An automated, multi-stage follow-up process to convert leads into site visits.'
  - baseline_cadence:
      - 'Rule 1: If `visit_status` is not `completed` within 3 days of initial contact, trigger a follow-up message.'
      - 'Rule 2: If `visit_status` is not `completed` within 10 days of initial contact, trigger a second follow-up message.'
      - 'Rule 3: If `visit_status` is not `completed` within 30 days of initial contact, trigger a final follow-up message.'
  - exit_condition: 'The nurturing sequence for a lead terminates immediately if the lead indicates they are no longer interested.'

Autonomous_Strategy_Optimization:
  - description: 'Empowers an AI agent to act as a strategic advisor, proposing monthly optimizations to the lead nurturing strategy.'
  - authorized_agent: 'Independent Risk Advisory AI'
  - objective: 'To propose a new, optimized lead nurturing strategy on a monthly basis that maximizes the `lead_to_visit_conversion_rate` while minimizing the `total_monthly_whatsapp_cost`.'
  - methodology:
      - 'The authorized agent will continuously analyze all relevant data, including `current_vacancy`, `predicted_future_vacancy`, `lead_scores`, `message_costs`, and historical `conversion_rates`.'
      - 'The agent will use this analysis to formulate a data-driven proposal for a new nurturing strategy for the upcoming month.'
  - governance:
      - 'The AI agent is strictly prohibited from implementing any changes autonomously.'
      - 'On the first of each month, the agent must generate a formal "Monthly Marketing Optimization Proposal" and enqueue it for CEO approval using the `tasks.create_strategy_proposal_request` capability.'
      - 'The existing nurturing strategy remains in effect until the CEO formally approves a new one.'
