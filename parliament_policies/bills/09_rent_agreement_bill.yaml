version: 3.0 # Major revision for template and e-signing

versioning_policy:
  - type: 'semantic_versioning_with_data_link'
    description: 'This policy follows semantic versioning. Every executed rent agreement is a legal document and must be versioned and stored immutably. The tenant record must link to the exact version of the agreement they signed.'
    data_impact: 'This is a cornerstone document. The system must ensure that the signed artifact is preserved perfectly.'

depends_on:
  - 'parliament_policies/bills/01_tenant_onboarding_bill.yaml'
  - 'parliament_policies/bills/02_monthly_billing_collections_bill.yaml'

core_principles:
  - 'The official source for the rent agreement is the version-controlled template located at `templates/rent_agreement_v1.md`.'
  - 'The rent agreement must be executed digitally via a third-party e-sign provider that supports Aadhar-based e-signatures.'
  - 'The agreement process can only be initiated after the tenant has reached the `ready_for_agreement` state in the Tenant Onboarding policy, which requires the payment of both the full first month''s rent AND the full security deposit.'
  - 'The cost of the e-signing service is a billable event and will be added to the tenant''s next monthly bill.'
  - 'The system must store a versioned, immutable copy of the exact agreement sent to the tenant for signing.'
