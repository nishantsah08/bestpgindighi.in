version: 2.0
policy_type: legal

versioning_policy:
  - type: 'semantic_versioning_with_data_link'
  - description: 'This policy follows semantic versioning. Every executed rent agreement is a legal document and must be versioned and stored immutably. The tenant record must link to the exact version of the agreement they signed.'
  - data_impact: 'This is a cornerstone document. The system must ensure that the signed artifact is preserved perfectly.'

parameters_file: '09_rent_agreement_parameters.md'

core_principles:
  - 'The rent agreement is a formal legal document executed digitally via a third-party e-sign provider.'
  - 'The agreement process can only be initiated after all financial and documentation prerequisites from the Tenant Onboarding policy have been met.'
  - 'The system must store a versioned, immutable copy of the exact agreement sent to the tenant for signing.'
  - 'The content of the agreement, including all legal clauses, is managed outside of this policy, but its execution is governed by it.'
