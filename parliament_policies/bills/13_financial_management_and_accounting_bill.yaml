# Bill to Establish the Ministry of Finance and Define Financial Policy
version: 1.0
policy_type: foundational

status: ACTIVE

description: >
  This bill formally establishes the Ministry of Finance and defines the immutable
  policies that govern all financial operations within the system.

core_principles:
  - principle: Controlled Correction via Reversal
    description: >
      No financial transaction can ever be deleted. Errors must be corrected via a
      CEO-authorized, fully audited reversal process, which creates a new reversing
      entry and a new correct entry, preserving a complete transaction history.

revenue_recognition:
  - process: Automated Revenue Recognition
    description: >
      The system will use an intelligent router to identify and process all incoming payments.
    workflow_steps:
      - "Step 1: The Financial AI receives a payment message from the intelligent router."
      - "Step 2: The AI processes the payment and records it as revenue."
      - "Step 3: Upon successful recording, the Financial AI immediately sends an automated acknowledgement message to the customer on WhatsApp. This message must include the amount received and a unique, internal `transaction_reference_id`."

ambiguous_payment_clarification:
  - process: AI-Assisted Clarification
    description: >
      If the Financial AI cannot confidently break down a payment into its component parts (e.g., rent, electricity, late fees), it will enqueue a task for the Sales Agent to provide a manual breakdown.
    workflow_steps:
      - "Step 1: The Financial AI identifies a payment that requires a manual breakdown."
      - "Step 2: The AI enqueues a 'Clarification Required' task for the Sales Agent in the Sales App, including the transaction details and the `transaction_reference_id`."
      - "Step 3: The Sales Agent provides the breakdown in the Sales App."
      - "Step 4: The Financial AI updates the transaction record with the breakdown provided by the Sales Agent."

expense_management:
  - process: Conversational Expense Filing
    description: >
      All expenses are filed via a conversational AI workflow on WhatsApp.
    external_interface: WhatsApp Business API
    actors: ["CEO"]
    workflow_steps:
      - "Trigger: CEO sends WhatsApp message (text, image, or combined)."
      - "Step 1: AI performs OCR and NLP analysis and calculates a Confidence Score for each extracted data point (Vendor, Amount, Date)."
      - "Step 2: If confidence is low on any data point, the AI will explicitly ask for manual confirmation or correction."
      - "Step 3: AI initiates a single, consolidated clarification dialogue with the verified data."
      - "Step 4: CEO provides answers to the questionnaire."
      - "Step 5: AI confirms final structured data."
      - "Step 6: CEO gives final approval."
      - "Step 7: Transaction is irreversibly filed."

chart_of_accounts:
  - standard: Indian Accounting Standards
  - description: >

      `14_chart_of_accounts.yaml` policy document.
