# Bill to Establish the Ministry of Finance and Define Financial Policy
version: 3.0 # Constitutional update for AI-driven visual data processing.
policy_type: foundational

status: ACTIVE

description: >
  This bill formally establishes the Ministry of Finance and defines the immutable
  policies that govern all financial operations within the system.

core_principles:
  - principle: Controlled Correction via Reversal
    description: >
      No financial transaction can ever be deleted. Errors must be corrected via a
      CEO-authorized, fully audited reversal process, which creates a new reversing
      entry and a new correct entry, preserving a complete transaction history.

cash_out_authorization:
  - principle: "CEO-Exclusive Cash-Out Authority"
    description: >
      The final authorization for any outgoing transfer of funds from the business
      (e.g., security deposit refunds, vendor payments) is the exclusive responsibility
      of the CEO. The Financial AI is authorized to prepare all necessary calculations
      and documentation, but the final execution of the payment can only be performed
      by the CEO.

revenue_recognition:
  - process: Automated Revenue Recognition
    description: >
      The system will use an intelligent router to identify and process all incoming payments.
    workflow_steps:
      - "Step 1: The Financial AI receives a payment message from the intelligent router."
      - "Step 2: The AI processes the payment and records it as revenue."
      - "Step 3: Upon successful recording, the Financial AI immediately sends an automated acknowledgement message to the customer on WhatsApp. This message must include the amount received and a unique, internal `transaction_reference_id`."

ambiguous_payment_clarification:
  - process: AI-Assisted Clarification
    description: >
      If the Financial AI cannot confidently break down a payment into its component parts (e.g., rent, electricity, late fees), it will enqueue a task for the Sales Agent to provide a manual breakdown.
    workflow_steps:
      - "Step 1: The Financial AI identifies a payment that requires a manual breakdown."
      - "Step 2: The AI enqueues a 'Clarification Required' task for the Sales Agent in the Sales App, including the transaction details and the `transaction_reference_id`."
      - "Step 3: The Sales Agent provides the breakdown in the Sales App."
      - "Step 4: The Financial AI updates the transaction record with the breakdown provided by the Sales Agent."

expense_management:
  - process: AI-Powered Expense Filing
    description: >
      Expenses are filed via the System Operations Channel (SOC). This workflow is authorized by Constitution Amendments III and IV, allowing the AI to process text, images, and PDFs.
    external_interface: WhatsApp Business API (via SOC)
    actors: ["CEO"]
    workflow_steps:
      - "Trigger: CEO sends a message, an image of a receipt, or a PDF invoice to the SOC."
      - "Step 1: The AI uses NLU and/or OCR to extract structured data (e.g., vendor, amount, date)."
      - "Step 2: The AI initiates the mandatory 'AI Confirmation Loop' by presenting the extracted, structured data back to the CEO for review."
      - "Step 3: The CEO provides explicit, affirmative confirmation."
      - "Step 4: The transaction is irreversibly filed in the General Ledger."

chart_of_accounts:
  - standard: Indian Accounting Standards
  - description: >
      The system will use the official Chart of Accounts as defined in the
      `14_chart_of_accounts.yaml` policy document.

judicial_financial_controls:
  - rule: Mandatory CEO Review
    description: >
      All financial disputes or corrections with a value greater than â‚¹500 must be
      reviewed and approved by the CEO, as per the process defined in the
      Judicial Review Process document.
