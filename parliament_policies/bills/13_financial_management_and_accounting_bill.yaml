# Bill to Establish the Ministry of Finance and Define Financial Policy
version: 1.0
policy_type: foundational

status: ACTIVE

description: >
  This bill formally establishes the Ministry of Finance and defines the immutable
  policies that govern all financial operations within the system.

core_principles:
  - principle: Controlled Correction via Reversal
    description: >
      No financial transaction can ever be deleted. Errors must be corrected via a
      CEO-authorized, fully audited reversal process, which creates a new reversing
      entry and a new correct entry, preserving a complete transaction history.

revenue_recognition:
  - process: Automated Revenue Recognition from Sales Channel
    description: >
      The system will passively monitor the main WhatsApp channel. When a message
      from a customer contains evidence of a payment (e.g., a payment screenshot
      or text confirming payment), the system will automatically fork this information
      to the Financial AI to be recorded as revenue. The Sales agent does not need
      to take any special action.

expense_management:
  - process: Conversational Expense Filing
    description: >
      All expenses are filed via a conversational AI workflow on WhatsApp.
    external_interface: WhatsApp Business API
    actors: ["CEO"]
    workflow_steps:
      - "Trigger: CEO sends WhatsApp message (text, image, or combined)."
      - "Step 1: AI performs OCR and NLP analysis and calculates a Confidence Score for each extracted data point (Vendor, Amount, Date)."
      - "Step 2: If confidence is low on any data point, the AI will explicitly ask for manual confirmation or correction."
      - "Step 3: AI initiates a single, consolidated clarification dialogue with the verified data."
      - "Step 4: CEO provides answers to the questionnaire."
      - "Step 5: AI confirms final structured data."
      - "Step 6: CEO gives final approval."
      - "Step 7: Transaction is irreversibly filed."

chart_of_accounts:
  - standard: Indian Accounting Standards
  - description: >
      The system will use the official Chart of Accounts as defined in the
      `14_chart_of_accounts.yaml` policy document.

judicial_financial_controls:
  - rule: Mandatory CEO Review
    description: >

      reviewed and approved by the CEO, as per the process defined in the
      Judicial Review Process document.
