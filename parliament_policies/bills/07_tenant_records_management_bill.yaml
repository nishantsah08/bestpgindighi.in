core_principles:
  - 'All compliance-related documents (e.g., IDs, Police Verification forms, Signed Agreements) must be stored permanently in a version-controlled system.'
  - 'The storage system must guarantee immutability and provide a clear audit trail for all documents.'
  - 'Access to sensitive tenant records is restricted to authorized personnel, as defined in the parameters file.'
  - 'The police verification acknowledgement PDF is considered a critical compliance document and must be stored permanently and immutably alongside other tenant records.'
  - 'Compliance-related information must never be deleted from the system, even after a tenant has offboarded.'
