# Bill to Define the System-Wide Cost Optimization Strategy
version: 1.0
policy_type: foundational

status: DRAFT

description: >
  This bill establishes the foundational economic principles for all architectural
  and deployment decisions. The primary goal is to maintain a near-zero operational
  cost while delivering full functionality.

principles:
  - principle: Free Tier First
    description: >
      For any new service, component, or dependency, solutions with a substantial
      and sufficient free tier must be evaluated and prioritized over solutions
      with immediate or fixed recurring costs.

  - principle: Serverless Over Servers
    description: >
      On-demand, serverless architectures (e.g., Google Cloud Functions) shall be
      the default choice over always-on, provisioned virtual machines. This minimizes
      cost by eliminating payment for idle compute time.

  - principle: Efficiency in Design
    description: >
      All new features and MCP capabilities must be designed to be resource-efficient.
      This includes minimizing unnecessary database reads, optimizing data storage structures,
      and writing efficient code.

  - principle: Monitor Key Cost Drivers
    description: >
      The system must actively monitor known, high-variable cost drivers. This includes
      "Firestore Read/Write Operations" and "Verification AI Document Analysis Events".
      The Auditor AI is responsible for reporting on these metrics.

  - principle: Justification for Paid Services
    description: >
      Moving any component from a free tier to a paid tier requires a formal
      cost-benefit analysis to be documented and approved by the CEO. The analysis
      must prove that the expected business value significantly outweighs the new cost.
