# Chapter 12: Parallel Development & Team Collaboration

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-07-23

## 12.1 Core Principle: Service-Based Ownership

Each microservice is a self-contained unit of work. A developer or a small team will be the "owner" of one or more services, responsible for its development, deployment, and maintenance.

## 12.2 The Gemini Parallel Workflow Model

This workflow is designed to maximize development speed while minimizing merge conflicts and integration issues.

### 12.2.1 Diagram: The Parallel Development Workflow

- **Visual Asset:** `![Parallel Development Workflow](./assets/visuals/12_parallel_dev.svg)`
- **Source Code (Mermaid):**
  ```mermaid
  graph TD
      A[Project Manager assigns Feature] --> B{Break down into tasks per service};
      B --> C[Dev A works on Finance Service];
      B --> D[Dev B works on Frontend Portal];
      B --> E[Dev C works on Feedback Service];
      C --> F[Mocks other services based on API Spec];
      D --> F;
      E --> F;
      F --> G{All devs work independently};
      G --> H[Dev A merges to develop branch];
      G --> I[Dev B merges to develop branch];
      H --> J[CI Pipeline runs integration tests];
      I --> J;
  ```

### 12.2.2 The API Contract is King

The `02_API_SPECIFICATION.yaml` is the immutable contract that enables this parallel work. As long as each developer's service adheres to the contract, their work will integrate seamlessly.

### 12.2.3 Mocking Dependencies

During local development, developers will use a tool like **Prism** to run a mock server that simulates the API responses from other services based on the OpenAPI specification. This allows for completely independent development and testing without needing to run the entire system locally.

## 12.3 Conflict Resolution Strategy

- **API Conflicts:** Any proposed change to the API contract must be discussed and agreed upon by all affected service owners before being merged. This is a high-friction event by design.
- **Code Conflicts:** Standard Git rebase and merge strategies will be used to resolve code-level conflicts within a single service.
