# Chapter 13: Future Evolution & Change Management

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-07-23

## 13.1 Core Principle: Backward Compatibility

The system must be able to evolve without breaking existing functionality or losing historical data.

## 13.2 The Safe Evolution Workflow (The "Amendment Process")

All significant changes to the system must follow a structured, policy-first workflow.

      C --> E[Begin Development];
      D --> A;
  ```

## 13.3 Preserving Old Data: The "Schema Evolution" Mandate

### 13.3.1 No Destructive Changes
It is constitutionally prohibited to delete or rename existing fields in the database that may contain production data.

### 13.3.2 The "Additive & Versioned" Approach
To change a feature, new fields must be added (e.g., `calculated_overall_satisfaction_score_v2`). The application code must then be updated to handle both the old (`v1`) and new (`v2`) fields. This allows for a gradual migration of data and functionality.

### 13.3.3 Data Migration Strategy
For major schema changes, a dedicated data migration script will be written. This script will be run as a background task to iterate through all existing records and populate the new fields, ensuring no data is lost during the transition.
