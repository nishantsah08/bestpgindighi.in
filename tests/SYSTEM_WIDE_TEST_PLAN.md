# System-Wide Test Plan

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the autonomous management system. Our goal is to ensure reliability, security, and correctness across all components.

## 1. Unit Testing

- **Objective:** To test individual components (e.g., a single function, a specific class) in isolation.
- **Location:** Unit tests will be co-located with the source code they are testing.
- **Frameworks:** Standard testing frameworks for each language will be used (e.g., JUnit for Kotlin, pytest for Python).

## 2. Integration Testing

- **Objective:** To test the interaction between two or more components.
- **Scope:** This includes testing the interaction between an AI agent and an MCP service, or between two MCP services.
- **Method:** These tests will be run in a controlled environment with mocked dependencies.

## 3. Protocol Conformance Testing

Given our reliance on the Model Context Protocol (MCP), a new category of testing is required to ensure the integrity of our distributed system.

- **Objective:** To verify that any service we build or integrate correctly and securely implements the MCP standard.
- **Process:** We will develop a standardized MCP conformance test suite.
- **Requirements:** Any new MCP-compliant service must pass this conformance test suite before it can be registered in the `05_MCP_CAPABILITY_REGISTRY.md` and deployed to production.

## 4. End-to-End (E2E) Testing

- **Objective:** To test a complete business flow from start to finish.
- **Example:** A test that simulates a new lead being generated on the public website, flowing through the sales process, and resulting in a new tenant being onboarded and billed.
- **Environment:** E2E tests will be run in a staging environment that is a near-perfect replica of production.

## 5. AI Model Validation

- **Objective:** To ensure the correctness, fairness, and security of the Verification AI.
- **Test Data:** A curated dataset of valid and invalid documents will be used to test the model's accuracy.
- **Bias Testing:** The test dataset will include a diverse range of document types and qualities to ensure the model is not biased.
- **Security Testing:** The model will be tested against adversarial attacks (e.g., forged documents).

## 6. Business Logic Rule Testing

- **Objective:** To validate the correctness of the business logic defined in the `.yaml` policy files.
- **Method:** Each rule will be tested with a dedicated set of unit tests that provide sample inputs and assert the expected outcome.

## 7. User Acceptance Testing (UAT)

- **Objective:** To allow the CEO and other key stakeholders to test new features and confirm they meet business requirements.
- **Process:** UAT will be conducted in the staging environment before any major new feature is released to production.
