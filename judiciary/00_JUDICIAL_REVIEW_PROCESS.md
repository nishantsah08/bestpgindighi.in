# 00 - Judicial Review Process

This document outlines the constitutional mandate for all system changes, governed by the Supreme Court Review.

## 1. The 3D Logical Model

The cornerstone of this protocol is the **3D Logical Model**. This is not a *representation* of the system; it **is the system** in its pure, logical form. The deployed code is the material expression of this model.

The model's 3D structure is defined as follows:
- **X-axis (Horizontal):** Represents the different business domains or "ministries" (e.g., Onboarding, Billing, Maintenance).
- **Y-axis (Vertical):** Represents the layers of abstraction within a domain, from high-level policy down to specific parameters and implementation details.
- **Z-axis (Depth):** Represents the flow of events and triggers that connect different domains and layers.

## 2. The Supreme Court Review Mandate

No change to the system's logical model (i.e., any change to a policy, parameter, or architectural document) is permissible without passing a rigorous **Supreme Court Review**. This review is a mandatory, three-step process:

1.  **Integration Simulation:** The proposed change (the "new logical unit") is tentatively placed into the 3D Logical Model.
2.  **Dependency Analysis:** All connections from the new unit are traced along all three axes to identify every other policy, parameter, or document that is either directly or semantically linked to it.
3.  **Full Consistency Scan:** A full validation scan is performed across the entire model to ensure there are no contradictions, orphaned triggers, or logical inconsistencies created by the change.

## 3. Precedent for Procedural Efficiency

Any significant, time-wasting procedural issue that is resolved during operations must be documented as a new Case File in the `judiciary/cases/` directory. This creates a body of precedent that the AI Agent must review during its startup sequence, ensuring that past inefficiencies are not repeated. The resolution documented in the case file becomes binding law for all future, similar operations.

## 4. Jurisdiction Over Autonomous Agents

The Judiciary's mandate is hereby extended to include the review of decisions made by autonomous AI agents. If a customer or employee disputes a decision made by an agent (e.g., the Verification AI), they may file a case. The Judiciary has the authority to examine the agent's operational logs and to overturn its decision if it is found to be inconsistent with established policy or constitutional principles.
