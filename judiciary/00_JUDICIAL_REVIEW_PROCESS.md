# 00 - Judicial Review Process

This document outlines the constitutional mandate for all system changes, governed by the Supreme Court Review.

## 1. The 3D Logical Model

The cornerstone of this protocol is the **3D Logical Model**. This is not a *representation* of the system; it **is the system** in its pure, logical form. The deployed code is the material expression of this model.

The model's 3D structure is defined as follows:
- **X-axis (Horizontal):** Represents the different business domains or "ministries" (e.g., Onboarding, Billing, Maintenance).
- **Y-axis (Vertical):** Represents the layers of abstraction within a domain, from high-level policy down to specific parameters and implementation details.
- **Z-axis (Depth):** Represents the flow of events and triggers that connect different domains and layers.

## 2. The Supreme Court Review Mandate

No change to the system's logical model (i.e., any change to a policy, parameter, or architectural document) is permissible without passing a rigorous **Supreme Court Review**. This review is a mandatory, three-step process:

1.  **Integration Simulation:** The proposed change (the "new logical unit") is tentatively placed into the 3D Logical Model.
2.  **Dependency Analysis:** All connections from the new unit are traced along all three axes to identify every other policy, parameter, or document that is either directly or semantically linked to it.
3.  **Full Consistency Scan:** A full validation scan is performed across the entire model to ensure there are no contradictions, orphaned triggers, or logical inconsistencies created by the change.

Only if a plan passes all three of these steps can it be considered constitutionally valid. The AI Agent is responsible for executing this review and presenting its findings.
