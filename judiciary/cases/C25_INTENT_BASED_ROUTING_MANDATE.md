# Case C25: Intent-Based Routing Mandate

**Date Filed:** 2025-07-23

## 1. Finding

A strategic directive has been issued to transition the system from a keyword-driven or structured-command-based interaction model to a full, AI-driven, intent-based routing model. This represents a foundational shift in the system's operational philosophy.

## 2. Analysis

The previous model, while reliable and auditable, provided a rigid user experience and did not fully leverage the system's AI capabilities. The new model prioritizes user experience and natural language interaction. This change, however, introduces the risk of misinterpretation of user intent.

To mitigate this risk, a new constitutional amendment, `03_AMENDMENT_AI_INTENT_AUTHORITY.md`, has been ratified. This amendment grants the AI the authority to interpret natural language but mandates a non-negotiable **AI Confirmation Loop** for all actions with financial, legal, or data-modification consequences.

This loop ensures that while the initial interaction is natural and fluid, the final execution is based on the user's explicit confirmation of a clearly structured, unambiguous action. This preserves the principles of auditability and user accountability required by the Constitution.

## 3. Verdict

The previous precedents favoring keyword or structured-command routing are hereby declared **superseded and nullified** by the ratification of Amendment III.

## 4. Precedent Established

This case establishes a new, binding precedent for all future system design and development:

1.  **The Primacy of Intent:** The system shall, by default, be designed to understand and act upon the natural language intent of the user.
2.  **The Mandate of Confirmation:** The **AI Confirmation Loop** is a mandatory security and auditability control for all consequential actions. An action may not be executed without the user first being presented with a structured summary of that action and providing an explicit, affirmative confirmation.
3.  **The Invalidation of Rigid Interfaces:** The development of new features that rely on rigid, keyword-based interfaces is constitutionally discouraged. The preferred interaction model is natural language, mediated by the AI Confirmation Loop.
