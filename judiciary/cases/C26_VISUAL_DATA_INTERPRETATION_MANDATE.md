# Case C26: Visual Data Interpretation Mandate

**Date Filed:** 2025-07-23

## 1. Finding

A strategic directive has been issued to grant the system the capability to process and interpret visual data (images and PDFs) for the purpose of initiating financial transactions.

## 2. Analysis

This capability represents a significant evolution of the system, moving it beyond text-only interactions. It introduces new complexities and potential risks, primarily related to the accuracy of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and the authenticity of the source documents.

To govern this, a new constitutional amendment, `04_AMENDMENT_VISUAL_DATA_INTERPRETATION.md`, has been ratified. This amendment explicitly authorizes the use of visual data for financial workflows but subjects it to the same mandatory **AI Confirmation Loop** established in Amendment III.

This ensures that while the AI can automate the tedious task of data extraction from a document, a human user is always the final checkpoint, responsible for verifying both the accuracy of the extracted data and the legitimacy of the transaction itself.

## 3. Verdict

The system is now constitutionally authorized to perform financial data extraction from visual media.

## 4. Precedent Established

This case establishes a new, binding precedent for any feature involving visual data processing:

1.  **Confirmation is Mandatory:** The AI Confirmation Loop is non-negotiable for any action taken based on visually extracted data.
2.  **User Assumes Responsibility:** The act of confirming a transaction based on a visual document places the final responsibility for the transaction's authenticity and correctness on the human user, not the AI.
3.  **Focus on Extraction, Not Validation:** The AI's role is to be a data extraction tool, not a fraud detection or document authentication service. The system should assume the source document is legitimate until proven otherwise by human review or other dedicated security systems.
