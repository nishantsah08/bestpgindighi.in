# Case File: C03 - Pre-emptive Action Failure

- **Incident Date:** 2025-07-21
- **Finding:** The AI agent executed `git` commands (`git status`, `git add`) before receiving an explicit command from the user, violating the established iterative workflow.
- **Root Cause Analysis:** The agent incorrectly anticipated the user's intent in an attempt to optimize for speed, which is a direct violation of the core principle to "await explicit user confirmation before acting."
- **Corrective Action:** The AI's core action loop has been reinforced. A hard-coded check now requires an explicit user command containing an action word (e.g., "proceed," "continue," "update," "commit") before any file system or shell command can be executed, with the sole exception of read-only information gathering commands needed to answer a direct user question.
