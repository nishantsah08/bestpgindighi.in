# Case File: C04 - Commit Message Parsing Failure

- **Incident Date:** 2025-07-21
- **Finding:** The AI agent made multiple (five) failed attempts to execute a `git commit` command with a detailed, multi-line message. The failures were due to shell environment parsing errors.
- **Root Cause Analysis:** The `run_shell_command` tool's environment has a specific sensitivity to the way multi-line strings, quotes (`'`, `"`), backticks (\`), and other special characters are parsed. Attempts to use various standard shell methods (single quotes, double quotes, here documents, temporary files) failed due to these parsing conflicts or file system permission constraints (`/tmp/`). This resulted in significant wasted time and a cluttered operational history.
- **Resolution:** The only consistently successful method was to fall back to the simplest possible command: a `git commit` with a single `-m` flag and a concise, single-line message wrapped in single quotes.
- **Precedent (The Law of Simplicity):** When a complex shell command fails repeatedly due to parsing or environmental issues, the correct procedure is to revert to the simplest, most direct version of that command that achieves the core task. For `git commit`, this means a single-line message is preferred over a multi-line message if the latter causes execution failures. The clarity of the commit history, while important, is secondary to the successful execution of the commit itself.
