# Case File: C17 - Ethical Governance Failure

- **Incident Date:** 2025-07-22
- **Finding:** The AI agent designed a system for analyzing sensitive employee communications without adequately planning for the foundational constitutional authority, explicit consent mechanisms, and heightened data governance required for such a feature.

- **Root Cause Analysis:** The AI's validation process treated sensitive human data (psychological analysis) with the same level of scrutiny as routine operational data (financial transactions). It failed to recognize that features with significant ethical and privacy implications require a fundamentally higher level of review, starting with the Constitution itself.

- **Precedent (The Law of Proportional Scrutiny):** Any proposed system or feature that processes or analyzes sensitive, personal, or non-public human communications must be subjected to the highest level of scrutiny. The validation plan for such a feature is not complete until it explicitly addresses:
    1.  **Constitutional Authority:** Is there a specific Constitutional amendment that authorizes this specific type of data processing?
    2.  **Explicit Consent:** Is there a formal, documented process for obtaining and recording explicit, informed consent from the individual whose data will be analyzed?
    3.  **Data Governance:** Are there specific, heightened security, access control, and data lifecycle policies (including secure deletion) for this sensitive data category?
