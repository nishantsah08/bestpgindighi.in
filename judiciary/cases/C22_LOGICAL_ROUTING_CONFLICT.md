# Case C22: Logical Routing Conflict Failure

**Date Filed:** 2025-07-22

## 1. Finding

A critical conflict exists between a technical specification and a system policy, resulting in the complete failure of the expense management workflow. The system has two contradictory sets of instructions for routing incoming WhatsApp messages.

- **Technical Specification:** `executive/ministry_of_technology_and_digital_infrastructure/development_department/docs/06_WHATSAPP_WEBHOOK_SPECIFICATION.md`
- **Conflicting Policy:** `parliament_policies/bills/10_customer_interaction_and_call_management_bill.yaml`

## 2. Analysis

The Supreme Court review has identified a functional paralysis in the system, termed the "Deaf Financial AI" problem.

1.  The webhook specification, a core technical document, explicitly states that the **Financial AI Agent** is the sole subscriber to the WhatsApp message queue. This is the designated channel for the CEO and Owners to file expenses.
2.  Simultaneously, the customer interaction bill, an active policy, mandates that **all** inbound WhatsApp communications be routed to the **Sales Agent Queue**.

This creates a direct and irreconcilable conflict. The system's policy layer is actively preventing the technical infrastructure from functioning as designed. As a result, the Financial AI is cut off from its primary input channel, rendering the entire expense filing process inoperable.

This is a high-impact failure as it breaks a core, constitutionally-defined financial process.

## 3. Verdict

The `10_customer_interaction_and_call_management_bill.yaml` is hereby declared to be in **direct violation of system logic**. Its simplistic, catch-all routing rule fails to account for the specialized communication channels required by other system agents, making it unfit for purpose.

## 4. Precedent Established

This case establishes a binding precedent for all future policy and technical design:

1.  **Principle of Intelligent Routing:** A communication routing policy cannot be monolithic. It must be intelligent enough to differentiate between message types, senders, or content, and route them to the appropriate agent or queue based on a clear set of rules.
2.  **Technical Specification Supremacy:** When a technical specification defines a specific communication channel for a core system agent, no general policy can override it. The policy must be adapted to respect the specialized channel.
3.  **Immediate Remediation Mandate:** The `10_customer_interaction_and_call_management_bill.yaml` must be immediately amended to include intelligent routing logic that directs messages from authorized financial actors (CEO) to the Financial AI Agent, while routing all other customer communications to the Sales Agent Queue.
