# Case C23: Revenue Workflow Failure

**Date Filed:** 2025-07-22

## 1. Finding

A critical logical contradiction has been identified between system policy and technical specification, resulting in the complete failure of the WhatsApp-based revenue recording workflow for the Sales team.

- **Authorizing Policy:** `parliament_policies/bills/13_financial_management_and_accounting_bill.yaml`
- **Contradictory Routing Policy:** `parliament_policies/bills/10_customer_interaction_and_call_management_bill.yaml`
- **Technical Specification:** `executive/ministry_of_technology_and_digital_infrastructure/development_department/docs/06_WHATSAPP_WEBHOOK_SPECIFICATION.md`

## 2. Analysis

The Supreme Court review has identified a "split brain" paradox within the Financial AI's operational design.

1.  The `13_financial_management_and_accounting_bill.yaml` explicitly grants the `Sales` role the authority to record revenue via WhatsApp.
2.  However, the `10_customer_interaction_and_call_management_bill.yaml` fails to route messages from the Sales team to the financial system. Its default rule sends all non-CEO WhatsApp messages to the `sales_agent_queue`.
3.  This directly conflicts with the technical specification, which designates the Financial AI as the sole processor for financial messages received via the WhatsApp webhook.

This contradiction renders the Financial AI deaf to revenue reports from the Sales team. The result is a broken core business process, leading to inaccurate financial records and unrealized revenue.

## 3. Verdict

The `10_customer_interaction_and_call_management_bill.yaml` is declared **unfit for purpose** due to its failure to provide a routing mechanism for all authorized financial workflows.

## 4. Precedent Established

This case reinforces and expands upon the precedent set in `C22_LOGICAL_ROUTING_CONFLICT.md`:

1.  **Intelligent Routing Must Be Comprehensive:** The system's routing policies must account for **all** authorized workflows specified in other policies. A simple role-based check is insufficient if different roles have overlapping communication channels.
2.  **Content-Aware Routing:** When a single channel (like WhatsApp) is used for multiple purposes by the same role (e.g., Sales for customer interaction and revenue reporting), the routing logic must be sophisticated enough to differentiate based on message content or keywords.
3.  **Immediate Remediation Mandate:** The `10_customer_interaction_and_call_management_bill.yaml` must be immediately amended to include a content-aware intelligent routing rule that directs revenue-related messages from the Sales team to the Financial AI queue, while allowing standard customer interactions to flow to the sales queue.
