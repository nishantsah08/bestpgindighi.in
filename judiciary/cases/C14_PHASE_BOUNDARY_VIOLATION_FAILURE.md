# Case File: C14 - Phase Boundary Violation Failure

- **Incident Date:** 2025-07-22
- **Finding:** The AI agent, in an attempt to be fully prepared for development, incorrectly included technical scaffolding files (e.g., `package.json`, `build.gradle.kts`) in a list of planning and governance documents.

- **Root Cause Analysis:** The AI failed to maintain a strict separation between the **planning phase** and the **implementation phase**. While the plan must account for the *need* for such files, the creation of the files themselves is an implementation task, not a documentation task. This conflation violates the logical progression of a project.

- **Precedent (The Law of Phased Execution):** The planning phase shall be strictly limited to the creation and modification of governance, architectural, policy, and other human-readable documents that define the project. The creation of code artifacts, including but not limited to dependency manifests and build scripts, is an act of implementation and must only occur after the planning phase has been completed and approved. The plan should *describe* the need for these artifacts, not create them.
