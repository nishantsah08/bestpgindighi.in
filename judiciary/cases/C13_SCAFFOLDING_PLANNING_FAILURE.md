# Case File: C13 - Scaffolding Planning Failure

- **Incident Date:** 2025-07-22
- **Finding:** The AI agent proposed a comprehensive documentation plan but failed to include the foundational project scaffolding and dependency management files required to begin development.

- **Root Cause Analysis:** The AI's planning process did not extend to the level of project initialization. It treated new components like mobile apps and backend servers as abstract entities without planning for the essential manifest files (e.g., `package.json`, `build.gradle.kts`) that define their dependencies, scripts, and build configurations. This is a failure to bridge the gap between high-level architectural planning and low-level developer readiness.

- **Precedent (The Law of Developer Readiness):** A strategic plan is not considered complete until it includes a formal plan for the initial scaffolding of each new software component. For each new application, website, or server, the plan must explicitly account for the creation and basic structure of its primary dependency and build management file (e.g., `package.json` for Node.js projects, `build.gradle.kts` for Kotlin/Android projects).
