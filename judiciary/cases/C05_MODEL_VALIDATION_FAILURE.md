# Case File: C05 - Model Validation Failure

- **Incident Date:** 2025-07-22
- **Finding:** The AI agent incorrectly and repeatedly signaled `model validation passed` when its proposed plans contained critical logical contradictions with established project constraints and operational realities.

- **Root Cause Analysis:** The AI's internal validation check was too narrow. It successfully verified that a proposed plan was *internally consistent*, but it failed to perform a deeper validation against the *complete project context*. Two specific failures were identified:
    1.  **Model Generalization vs. Specific Constraint:** The AI defaulted to a general business best-practice (accepting multiple payment types) instead of adhering to a specific, user-defined constraint (a UPI-centric business model).
    2.  **Technical Idealism vs. Operational Reality:** The AI proposed a technically pure concept ("Transaction Immutability") without accounting for the practical, real-world business requirement for an error correction mechanism.

- **Precedent (The Law of Contextual Supremacy):** The `model validation passed` signal is hereby redefined. It no longer signifies mere internal consistency. To pass validation, a proposed plan must be rigorously checked against the **entirety of the established project context**. This includes:
    1.  All explicit user directives and constraints, which shall always supersede the AI's generalized models.
    2.  All documented policies and case files.
    3.  The practical, operational realities of a manually-operated business, which shall temper purely technical or idealistic proposals.

This precedent makes the validation process more robust and ensures that all future proposals are not just logically sound, but are also grounded and appropriate for this specific project.
