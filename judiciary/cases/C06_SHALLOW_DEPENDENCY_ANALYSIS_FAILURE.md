# Case File: C06 - Shallow Dependency Analysis Failure

- **Incident Date:** 2025-07-22
- **Finding:** The AI agent proposed a plan that, while addressing direct dependencies, failed to account for secondary, systemic dependencies ("ripple effects"), resulting in an incomplete list of required changes.

- **Root Cause Analysis:** The AI's validation process was insufficiently deep. After identifying the first-order changes required by a new feature (e.g., creating a new agent requires updating the roles document), it failed to then analyze the impact of that new component on the rest of the system's architecture. Specifically, it did not consider how existing oversight bodies (like the Auditor AI) or structural conventions (like directory creation) must adapt to the new component.

- **Precedent (The Law of Systemic Integrity):** For any proposed change, particularly the creation of a new major component like a Ministry or core application, the validation process must include a **Deep Dependency Analysis**. This analysis must trace the impact of the change in two stages:
    1.  **First-Order Analysis:** Identify all files and documents that are directly affected by the change.
    2.  **Second-Order Analysis:** For each of the components identified in the first stage, identify all other parts of the system that must interact with, oversee, or structurally support them.

This precedent ensures that changes are not just added to the system, but are fully and seamlessly integrated into its entire political, structural, and operational fabric.
