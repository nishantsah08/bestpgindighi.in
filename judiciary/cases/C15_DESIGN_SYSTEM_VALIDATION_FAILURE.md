# Case File: C15 - Design System Validation Failure

- **Incident Date:** 2025-07-22
- **Finding:** The AI agent documented a new, system-wide Brand & Design System but failed to subject it to a formal Judiciary Review before committing it.

- **Root Cause Analysis:** The AI incorrectly classified the Design System as a non-functional, descriptive document rather than as a foundational, system-wide policy. Any standard that dictates the rules for the implementation of all user-facing components is a form of legislation and has a systemic impact. The validation process was not triggered because it was not seen as a change to core business logic or architecture.

- **Precedent (The Law of Universal Governance):** All system-wide standards, including but not limited to Brand & Design Systems, UI/UX guidelines, and coding standards, are hereby classified as foundational policies. They must be treated as legislative acts and are subject to the full Supreme Court Review process before they can be ratified and committed. Their impact must be analyzed across all existing and planned components.
