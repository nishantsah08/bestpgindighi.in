# Case File: C10 - Project Enablement Failure

- **Incident Date:** 2025-07-22
- **Finding:** The AI agent proposed a documentation plan that was comprehensive for the system's end-state but failed to include documents essential for the project's initiation and long-term maintenance.

- **Root Cause Analysis:** The AI's analysis did not account for the full project lifecycle. It overlooked foundational prerequisites, including:
    1.  **Constitutional Authority:** Failing to question if the existing Constitution authorized the creation of the new systems.
    2.  **Initial Data State:** Failing to plan for the critical "Day 0" task of data migration and seeding.
    3.  **Implementation-Level Documentation:** Failing to require design documentation for complex code, which is essential for future developers.

- **Precedent (The Law of Project Realism):** Any strategic plan must now be validated against the full project lifecycle. The plan is not complete unless it includes:
    1.  A **Constitutional Review** to ensure all new components are explicitly authorized, creating amendments as necessary.
    2.  A **Data Migration & Seeding Plan** that defines how the system will be populated with its initial state.
    3.  A requirement within the **Development Workflow** for creating implementation-level design documents for any non-trivial component.
