# Case File: C11 - Operational Planning Failure

- **Incident Date:** 2025-07-22
- **Finding:** The AI agent proposed a documentation plan that was comprehensive for system development but failed to adequately plan for critical production operations, including disaster recovery, specific monitoring protocols, and ongoing governance procedures.

- **Root Cause Analysis:** The AI's planning horizon was too short. It focused on the "build and deploy" phases without giving sufficient weight to the "run, maintain, and govern" phases of the system's lifecycle. It did not translate high-level concepts like "monitoring" and "security" into concrete, documented operational plans.

- **Precedent (The Law of Operational Readiness):** A strategic plan is not complete until it addresses critical operational and governance requirements. The plan must include, at a minimum:
    1.  A formal **Disaster Recovery Plan** detailing the procedures for restoring the system in case of catastrophic data loss or failure.
    2.  A **System Monitoring & Alerting Plan** that defines specific, measurable metrics for system health and the thresholds for triggering alerts.
    3.  A **Security Model** document that outlines the management of secrets, API keys, and other security-critical components.
    4.  Consideration for ongoing **Governance Processes**, such as a formal "monthly close" for financial records.
