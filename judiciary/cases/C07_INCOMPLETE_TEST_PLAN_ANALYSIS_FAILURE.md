# Case File: C07 - Incomplete Test Plan Analysis Failure

- **Incident Date:** 2025-07-22
- **Finding:** The AI agent proposed a list of documentation changes for a new technical architecture but failed to include a necessary update to the system's test plan.

- **Root Cause Analysis:** The AI's dependency analysis, while correctly identifying changes to architectural, policy, and descriptive documents, did not extend to validation and testing documents. The AI failed to recognize that a change in a system's implementation (like adding a new API integration layer) logically mandates a corresponding change in the plan for how to test that system.

- **Precedent (The Law of Complete Validation):** Any proposed change to the system's architecture or implementation must be analyzed for its impact on **all** aspects of the project lifecycle, including testing and validation. The question is not just "What documents describe this change?" but also "What documents must be updated to ensure this change can be properly tested and verified?" The `SYSTEM_WIDE_TEST_PLAN.md` must be treated as a core, dynamic document that is reviewed for updates alongside architectural and policy documents.
