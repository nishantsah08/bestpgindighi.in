# Case C24: Hybrid Communication Channel Failure

**Date Filed:** 2025-07-22

## 1. Finding

A foundational flaw in the system's communication logic was identified, stemming from an incorrect understanding of how the primary WhatsApp business number is used. The previous model assumed exclusive channels, whereas the reality is a hybrid-use, shared inbox model.

## 2. Analysis

The previous logic, which attempted to route messages exclusively to either a sales agent or a financial AI, was fundamentally flawed. It failed to account for the real-world business need for a human sales agent to see all customer communications, including payment confirmations, to maintain conversational context and provide good customer service.

This flaw led to the creation of incorrect policies and the erroneous judicial verdicts in cases `C22_LOGICAL_ROUTING_CONFLICT.md` and `C23_REVENUE_WORKFLOW_FAILURE.md`.

The correct model is not to **route** messages, but to **monitor and fork**. All messages should be delivered to the human agent, while a parallel AI process monitors the conversation and forks a copy of relevant data (like financial transactions) to the appropriate automated system for background processing.

## 3. Verdict

1.  The logical model based on exclusive routing is hereby declared **invalid**.
2.  The verdicts and precedents set in cases `C22_LOGICAL_ROUTING_CONFLICT.md` and `C23_REVENUE_WORKFLOW_FAILURE.md` are hereby **superseded and nullified**.

## 4. Precedent Established

This case establishes a new, binding precedent for all system design involving shared communication channels:

1.  **The "Monitor and Fork" Principle:** For any communication channel that serves both human interaction and automated processing, the system must prioritize the human workflow. The primary path for all messages will be to the human agent.
2.  **Passive AI Monitoring:** Automated agents shall act as passive monitors on these channels. They are not to intercept or reroute messages, but to analyze a copy of the message traffic in parallel.
3.  **Workflow Triggering via Fork:** When an automated agent identifies a message relevant to its function (e.g., a payment confirmation), it shall "fork" the necessary data and initiate its own internal workflow, without removing the original message from the human agent's view.
