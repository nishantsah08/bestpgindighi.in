# Case File: C19 - Execution Strategy Failure

- **Incident Date:** 2025-07-22
- **Finding:** The AI agent produced a technically detailed and constitutionally sound blueprint for a system's end-state, but failed to create a corresponding plan for the project's execution, rollout, and human adoption.

- **Root Cause Analysis:** The AI's planning process was focused on the architectural "what" and not the project management "how." It failed to address critical real-world implementation challenges, including the ratification of policies, the practical details of data migration, the strategy for a phased rollout, and the plan for user training and change management.

- **Precedent (The Law of Executable Strategy):** A strategic plan is not complete until it is accompanied by a high-level **Project Execution & Rollout Plan**. This plan must bridge the gap between the blueprint and the implementation. It must, at a minimum, address:
    1.  **Governance:** The process for ratifying all `DRAFT` policies into `acts`.
    2.  **Data:** A detailed data migration plan, including source analysis and validation.
    3.  **Technology:** A phased rollout strategy to mitigate the risks of a "big bang" release.
    4.  **People:** A formal change management and user training plan.
