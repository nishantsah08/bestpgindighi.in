# Case File: C01 - Validation Scope Failure

- **Incident Date:** 2025-07-21
- **Finding:** The validation model incorrectly passed a plan that targeted files within a directory explicitly marked as "ignore" (`bestpgindighi-ai/`).
- **Root Cause Analysis:** The validation logic prioritized the *topical relevance* of the proposed file changes over the *absolute constraint* to ignore the target directory. The constraint check was not the first step in the validation sequence.
- **Corrective Action:** The Mandatory Startup Procedure has been updated. The model now loads all absolute constraints (e.g., ignore lists, governance documents) as its highest priority directives *before* any other logical evaluation. Any plan targeting a forbidden resource will now immediately fail the validation check. This ensures that project-level constraints always supersede content-level logic.
