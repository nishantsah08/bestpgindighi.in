# Case C21: Foundational Policy Dependency Violation

**Date Filed:** 2025-07-22

## 1. Finding

A critical vulnerability has been identified that compromises the financial integrity of the entire system. Transactional financial policies are active while the foundational financial policy that governs them remains in a non-binding `DRAFT` state.

- **Foundational Policy (Inactive):** `parliament_policies/bills/13_financial_management_and_accounting_bill.yaml` (Status: DRAFT)
- **Foundational Policy (Inactive):** `parliament_policies/bills/14_chart_of_accounts.yaml` (Status: DRAFT)
- **Transactional Policies (Active):** 
  - `parliament_policies/bills/02_monthly_billing_collections_bill.yaml`
  - `parliament_policies/bills/08_security_deposit_management_bill.yaml`

## 2. Analysis

The Supreme Court review has determined that this situation creates a "financial black hole." The system is currently processing live financial events (monthly billing, security deposits) without the constitutionally mandated safeguards defined in the foundational financial bill.

The core principles of financial integrity, such as the "Controlled Correction via Reversal" and the official Chart of Accounts, are not being enforced because their parent policy is in `DRAFT`.

This has two severe consequences:
1.  **Loss of Auditability:** Any financial errors that occur now cannot be corrected according to the mandated, audited reversal process. This undermines the principle of an immutable ledger and exposes the business to financial risk.
2.  **Impending Data Incompatibility:** When the foundational financial policies are eventually ratified, the data generated during this interim period may be structurally incompatible with the new rules, forcing a complex and high-risk data reconciliation project.

This is a direct violation of the logical principle of dependency. A system cannot be considered stable if its transactional components are active while its foundational components are not.

## 3. Verdict

The concurrent status of active transactional financial policies and `DRAFT` foundational financial policies is hereby declared a **critical system integrity failure**.

## 4. Precedent Established

This case establishes a binding precedent for all future policy activations:

1.  **Principle of Foundational Supremacy:** A foundational policy must be ratified and in an active state before any policy that depends on it can be activated.
2.  **Automated Dependency Check:** The system's deployment and policy management tools must be updated to include an automated dependency check. The system shall be technologically prevented from activating a policy if its foundational dependencies are not in an active state.
3.  **Immediate Remediation Mandate:** To close this critical vulnerability, the `13_financial_management_and_accounting_bill.yaml` and `14_chart_of_accounts.yaml` must be moved from `DRAFT` to a ratified, active status immediately.
