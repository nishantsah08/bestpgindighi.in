# Case File: C09 - Human-Centric Impact Failure

- **Incident Date:** 2025-07-22
- **Finding:** The AI agent proposed a list of documentation changes that was technically comprehensive from a system-to-system perspective but failed to include critical documents required for human users and new developers.

- **Root Cause Analysis:** The AI's dependency analysis was still too machine-centric. It did not adequately consider the end-user's need for manuals to operate the new systems, nor did it consider the need to update the highest-level project overview documents that serve as the primary entry point for any person trying to understand the project. It also overlooked the privacy implications of new data collection.

- **Precedent (The Law of Human-Centric Documentation):** Any plan that introduces new user-facing applications, significant new features, or new types of data collection must also include corresponding updates to human-centric documentation. The analysis must now include:
    1.  **User Manuals:** A plan to create or update user guides for any new applications or features.
    2.  **High-Level Overviews:** A mandatory review and update of the `docs/00_SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md` to reflect any major changes.
    3.  **Data Privacy Policies:** A review of data privacy implications and the creation or update of relevant privacy policies.
