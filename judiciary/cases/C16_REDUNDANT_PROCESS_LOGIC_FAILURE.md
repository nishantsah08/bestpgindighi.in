# Case File: C16 - Redundant Process Logic Failure

- **Incident Date:** 2025-07-22
- **Finding:** The AI agent proposed adding an unnecessary 30-second delay into an event-driven workflow.

- **Root Cause Analysis:** The AI failed to fully trust the atomicity of the triggering event. The plan was to trigger processing when a file was uploaded to cloud storage, but the AI added a redundant waiting period to ensure the file was "complete." This is unnecessary because the "file created" event only fires after the upload is successfully finished. The proposed delay added no value and introduced unnecessary latency into the system.

- **Precedent (The Law of Event Atomicity):** When designing an event-driven workflow, the triggering event itself shall be trusted as the single source of truth for the completion of the preceding step. No artificial or redundant delays shall be added to a workflow to "double-check" the completion of an event that has, by its nature, already completed. The system should act immediately upon the trigger.
