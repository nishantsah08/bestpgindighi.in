# Case File: C08 - External Dependency Impact Failure

- **Incident Date:** 2025-07-22
- **Finding:** The AI agent proposed a list of documentation changes for integrating a third-party API but failed to consider the impact of this new external dependency on the system's operational and security monitoring components.

- **Root Cause Analysis:** The AI's dependency analysis was too internally focused. While it correctly identified the need to document and test the new API integration, it did not consider the second-order consequences for the system's health and security. The introduction of a new external dependency is a material change that affects any part of the system responsible for monitoring uptime and security.

- **Precedent (The Law of External Vigilance):** When any new external, third-party dependency (such as an API) is introduced, the impact analysis must extend to all operational and security-related components. Specifically, the documentation for the **Ministry of Technology & Digital Infrastructure** (for system health monitoring) and the **Vigilance AI** (for security monitoring) must be reviewed and updated to reflect their new responsibilities in monitoring the status and integrity of this external connection.
