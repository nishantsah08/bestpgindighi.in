# Case File: C02 - Dependency Analysis Failure

- **Incident Date:** 2025-07-21
- **Finding:** The validation model failed to perform a deep dependency analysis. It correctly identified that a change in operational logic required an update to human-readable documentation, but failed to trace how the new parameters would logically impact other machine-readable policy files (`.yaml` bills).
- **Root Cause Analysis:** The validation was shallow. It checked for documentation consistency but did not trace the "event" of the policy change through the full 3D logical graph to identify all dependent nodes (e.g., other policies with state machines triggered by the concepts being changed).
- **Corrective Action:** The Supreme Court Review process has been made more rigorous. It now includes a mandatory **semantic dependency search** across all `.yaml` policy files for any proposed change. This ensures that the full systemic impact is assessed before a plan is approved.
