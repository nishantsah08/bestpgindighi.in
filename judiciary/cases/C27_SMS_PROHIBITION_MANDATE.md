# Case C27: SMS Prohibition Mandate

**Date Filed:** 2025-07-23

## 1. Finding

An inconsistency was identified in the system's documentation (`docs/05_BUSINESS_OPERATIONS_MODEL.md`), which referenced the use of SMS for tenant communication. This contradicts the established operational model, which relies exclusively on WhatsApp.

## 2. Analysis

The use of multiple communication channels for the same purpose introduces unnecessary complexity, cost, and potential for security vulnerabilities. It also fragments the audit trail of user communication, which violates the principle of a unified, auditable log.

To correct this, a new constitutional amendment, `05_AMENDMENT_COMMUNICATION_CHANNEL_LIMITATION.md`, has been ratified. This amendment formally prohibits the use of SMS for any automated system communication, establishing WhatsApp as the sole and exclusive channel.

## 3. Verdict

Any reference to SMS in system documentation or policy is hereby declared unconstitutional and must be rectified.

## 4. Precedent Established

This case establishes a new, binding precedent for all system design and development:

1.  **Single Channel Mandate:** WhatsApp is the only permissible channel for automated, outbound textual communication from the system.
2.  **Documentation Consistency:** All system documentation must be consistent with this single-channel mandate. Any future reference to other textual communication channels is a violation of this precedent.
