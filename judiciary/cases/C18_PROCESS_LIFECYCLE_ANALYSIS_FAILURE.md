# Case File: C18 - Process Lifecycle Analysis Failure

- **Incident Date:** 2025-07-22
- **Finding:** The AI agent designed a new business process but failed to document the required changes for its failure paths, testing procedures, and human interaction points.

- **Root Cause Analysis:** The AI's analysis was focused on the "happy path" of the new process. It did not perform a complete lifecycle analysis, which includes considering edge cases (e.g., what if language detection fails?), validation requirements (how is this tested?), and the impact on human users (what does the user manual need to say?).

- **Precedent (The Law of Process Completeness):** When defining any new business process, the analysis is not complete until it explicitly documents the entire process lifecycle. This must include:
    1.  The primary success path.
    2.  All potential failure paths and their corresponding fallback procedures.
    3.  The specific test cases required to validate the process.
    4.  All required updates to user manuals explaining the new process to human operators.
